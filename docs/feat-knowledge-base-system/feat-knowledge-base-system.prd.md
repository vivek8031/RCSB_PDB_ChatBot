# Intelligent RCSB PDB Knowledge Base System

## Overview

Implement an automated, intelligent knowledge base system for RCSB PDB documentation using RAGFlow with OpenAI GPT-4.1, optimized chunking, and RAPTOR hierarchical processing. This system will provide superior Q&A capabilities for protein structure research and PDB data management.

## Problem Statement

Current challenges in RCSB PDB documentation access:
- **Manual Knowledge Management**: No automated system for processing scientific documents
- **Suboptimal Chunking**: Generic text processing not optimized for scientific content
- **Limited Context Understanding**: Lack of hierarchical summarization for complex procedures
- **Poor Retrieval Quality**: Scientific terminology and context not properly handled
- **Deployment Complexity**: Knowledge base setup requires manual configuration

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- **G1**: Automated knowledge base initialization with optimal scientific document processing
- **G2**: Superior chunking strategy using RAPTOR + 512-token optimization for PDB content
- **G3**: OpenAI GPT-4.1 integration for enhanced understanding of scientific terminology
- **G4**: Universal deployment compatibility with existing Docker architecture
- **G5**: Comprehensive test coverage for knowledge base operations

### Non-Goals
- **NG1**: Real-time document updates during conversations
- **NG2**: Multi-language document processing (English-only initially)
- **NG3**: Custom embedding model training

## User Stories

- **As a researcher**, I want accurate answers about PDB deposition procedures from the knowledge base
- **As a developer**, I want automated knowledge base setup during deployment
- **As a system administrator**, I want reliable knowledge base testing and validation
- **As a biocurator**, I want comprehensive coverage of wwPDB documentation and procedures

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Automated dataset creation with optimal configuration for scientific documents
- **FR-002**: RAPTOR hierarchical chunking with 512-token optimization
- **FR-003**: OpenAI GPT-4.1 and text-embedding-3-large integration
- **FR-004**: DeepDoc PDF parser for complex scientific document layouts
- **FR-005**: Batch document processing with progress tracking
- **FR-006**: Knowledge base validation and quality metrics
- **FR-007**: Universal deployment integration with existing Docker setup

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001** (Performance): Dataset initialization completes within 5 minutes
- **NFR-002** (Reliability): 99% successful chunk processing rate
- **NFR-003** (Usability): Single-command knowledge base setup
- **NFR-004** (Observability): Comprehensive logging and processing metrics

## Security & Privacy

- **SEC-001**: Secure OpenAI API key management via environment variables
- **SEC-002**: No sensitive data exposure in logs or error messages
- **SEC-003**: Proper access controls for knowledge base operations
- **SEC-004**: Rate limiting for OpenAI API calls to prevent abuse

## API/Contract

### Knowledge Base Initialization
```python
from knowledge_base.initialize_dataset import create_rcsb_dataset

# Create and populate knowledge base
dataset = create_rcsb_dataset(
    name="rcsb_pdb_knowledge_base",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    ragflow_client=rag_client,
    force_recreate=False
)

# Returns: DatasetInfo with metrics
{
    "dataset_id": "uuid",
    "document_count": 4,
    "chunk_count": 156,
    "processing_time": 180.5,
    "status": "completed"
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria (Executable)

- **TC-001** ← FR-001: Given RAGFlow client and OpenAI key, When `create_rcsb_dataset()` is called, Then dataset is created with optimal configuration
- **TC-002** ← FR-002: Given PDF documents, When processed with RAPTOR, Then hierarchical summaries are generated successfully  
- **TC-003** ← FR-003: Given OpenAI integration, When documents are processed, Then GPT-4.1 and text-embedding-3-large are used
- **TC-004** ← FR-004: Given wwPDB PDF files, When parsed with DeepDoc, Then layout recognition extracts structured content
- **TC-005** ← FR-005: Given multiple documents, When batch processed, Then progress is tracked and reported
- **TC-006** ← FR-006: Given processed dataset, When validated, Then quality metrics meet acceptance thresholds
- **TC-007** ← FR-007: Given Docker deployment, When `./deploy.sh` runs, Then knowledge base is automatically initialized

## Risks & Unknowns

### Top Risks
- **R1**: OpenAI API rate limits during bulk processing (Mitigation: Batch processing with delays)
- **R2**: RAPTOR processing time exceeding acceptable limits (Mitigation: Async processing with progress tracking)
- **R3**: Scientific document complexity causing parsing failures (Mitigation: Multi-parser fallback strategy)

### Open Questions
- **Q1**: Optimal chunk overlap percentage for scientific content?
- **Q2**: Should we cache processed chunks to reduce API costs?
- **Q3**: How to handle document updates without full reprocessing?

## Telemetry & Success Metrics

### KPIs
- **Dataset Initialization Time**: < 5 minutes for full knowledge base
- **Chunk Processing Success Rate**: > 99%
- **API Cost Efficiency**: < $2 per full knowledge base processing
- **Query Response Accuracy**: > 95% for PDB-related questions

### Events to Track
- `knowledge_base.initialization.started`
- `knowledge_base.document.processed`
- `knowledge_base.chunk.created`
- `knowledge_base.raptor.summary.generated`
- `knowledge_base.initialization.completed`

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Dependencies
- RAGFlow SDK v0.19.0+
- OpenAI API access with GPT-4.1 and embedding models
- Existing Docker deployment infrastructure
- Python environment with required packages

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing universal deployment architecture
- Cannot modify core RAGFlow client implementation
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing chat functionality
