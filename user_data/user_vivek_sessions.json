Below are the guidelines for the successful deposition of your structure.\n\n### Steps for Deposition\n\n1. **Determine File Formats**:\n   - Use PDBx/mmCIF format for structures exceeding 99,999 atoms or 62 chains.\n   - For X-ray crystallography submissions, both coordinates and structure factors must be uploaded.\n   - NMR submissions require coordinates, chemical shifts, restraints, and optionally, peak lists.\n   - 3DEM submissions need coordinates, map images, primary maps, and may include additional files.\n\n2. **File Upload**:\n   - Go to the \"Upload files\" page of the deposition interface.\n   - Select the appropriate file type for your coordinate and experimental data files (PDB or mmCIF for coordinates, mmCIF or mtz for structure factors).\n   - Follow any specific instructions provided on the file upload page and continue with the deposition process.\n\n3. **Data Requirements**:\n   - Submit full polymer sequences including any unmodeled residues.\n   - For ligands, ensure they match entries in the Chemical Component Dictionary or submit detailed chemical information if they are new.\n   - If your structure involves symmetry, provide refined chains and necessary symmetry operators.\n\n4. **Validation and Submission**:\n   - Preliminary validation reports are generated upon your initial upload and must be reviewed before submission.\n   - The progress bar will indicate the completion of mandatory data fields, transforming into a \"Submit\" button once everything is complete.\n   - You can revise and validate before final submission.\n\n5. **Finalizing Deposition**:\n   - Upon completion, accession codes such as PDB IDs are automatically assigned.\n   - For experimental methods, raw data should be deposited in curated archives, supplying a DOI during deposition.\n\n6. **Post-Deposition**:\n   - You may update coordinates once per year per entry after its release, affecting up to three entries per Principal Investigator per year.\n   - Experimental data cannot be altered once the entry has been publicly released.\n\nThese steps ensure that your biomolecular structure is deposited effectively and consistently within the wwPDB's guidelines [ID:2] [ID:3] [ID:4]. \n\nFor more detailed information or if you experience issues, refer to the specific guidelines on the wwPDB website or contact the wwPDB help desk.",
