The process includes preparing your coordinate files, experimental data (if any), ligand information, and annotations, and then uploading these through the OneDep deposition interface following the validation and annotation guidelines.\n\n## Detailed Information\n\n### Submission System and IDs\n- Depositions to RCSB PDB are done via the OneDep system at https://deposit.wwpdb.org.\n- Your login uses a **deposition ID** (starting with 'D_\u2026'), not a PDB ID.\n- Passwords are shared among all contact authors of the deposition.\n- ORCID login is being introduced but is not mandatory yet; ORCID is mandatory for contact authors.\n\n### Required Information and Files\n- Provide your **coordinate files**, typically in PDB or mmCIF format.\n- If X-ray or Neutron crystallography data is used, structure factor (SF) files are necessary. Use tools like the **SF-tool** (http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org) or **pdb_extract** to prepare combined SF files if you have multiple data sets (e.g., X-ray + Neutron).\n- For NMR structures, provide chemical shift files in **NMR-STAR 3.1 format**.\n- Include **ligand chemical information**, such as chemical structures (SMILE strings or images), binding mode details, and molecular function (inhibitor, substrate, etc.).\n- For Electron Microscopy (EM) structures, maps can be deposited in CCP4 or MRC format, with required metadata like voxel size and contour levels.\n- Provide metadata about experimental methods, authors, funding sources (select from existing lists or specify \"Other\" if not present).\n- Ensure alternate conformations and microheterogeneity are properly annotated.\n\n### Deposition Process Highlights\n- Upload files only in supported formats (e.g., .gz compressed files; note that mixing .gz, .zip, and .xz files in one deposition session is not allowed).\n- Follow instructions for polymer chain IDs, alternate conformations, and residue numbering for chemical entities.\n- If your structure involves TLS refinement, provide TLS records or conduct refinement without TLS if missing.\n- For water molecules on special positions, set occupancies according to multiplicity.\n- Provide all relevant metadata for validation (e.g., experimental details, synchrotron source information).\n- Validation reports will be available through the Communication section of OneDep during deposition.\n\n### Handling Large Files and Session Management\n- Files larger than 3GB should be uploaded via Box or FTP upon request.\n- Unsubmitted deposition sessions are deleted after 3 months of inactivity and cannot be recovered.\n- Use the OneDep **Communication Tool** to interact with annotation staff and resolve any validation or processing queries.\n\n### Useful Links and Tools\n- OneDep system for deposition: https://deposit.wwpdb.org\n- SF-tool for structure factor files: http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org\n- pdb_extract for data block processing: http://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/PDB_EXTRACT/source.html\n- For guidance on secondary structure and annotations, see software recommendations and contact support as needed.\n\n### Summary of Key Steps\n1. Prepare coordinate files (PDB/mmCIF) and experimental data files.\n2. Prepare ligand chemical information and metadata.\n3. Log in with your deposition ID at OneDep deposition system.\n4. Upload your data files following guided steps.\n5. Validate structure and data through OneDep\u2019s validation tools.\n6. Respond to any annotations or validation issues via Communication Tool.\n7. Finalize submission; depositions receive IDs in the appropriate range for RCSB PDB (e.g., D_10002\u2026 series).\n\n---\n\n**Knowledge Base Sources Referenced**: [ID:1] [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n```",

Specific file types, data formatting, and procedures must be followed as per wwPDB requirements. Additional helpful tools such as SF-tool and pdb_extract exist for preparing structure factor files. Login credentials are based on deposition IDs, and ORCID is mandatory for all contact authors. For large files or special cases, Box or FTP can be used.\n\n## Detailed Information\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Files\n- Coordinate files (e.g., PDB or mmCIF)\n- Experimental data such as structure factors (SF file), NMR chemical shifts, or EM maps\n- Ligand details including chemical structures and binding mode information if applicable\n- Metadata including authorship (mandatory ORCID for contact authors), funding sources, and experimental details\n\n### Step 2: Access the OneDep Deposition System\n- Login using your deposition ID (e.g., D_\u2026) as login credential; password is shared among contact authors\n- ORCID login is also supported for depositors with ORCID IDs\n- There is currently no mechanism to change passwords (use ORCID login when possible)\n\n### Step 3: Upload Required Files\n- Files must be uploaded in supported formats, such as .gz compressed files; mixing .gz with .zip or .xz in the same session is not supported\n- For structure factor files, SF-tool (http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org/) or pdb_extract utility can be used to prepare correct mmCIF or mtz files containing separate X-ray and neutron data blocks if applicable\n- For large files (>3GB), use Box platform or request FTP upload access through the communication page in the deposition interface\n\n### Step 4: Provide Metadata and Annotation\n- Provide a descriptive title for the structure entry\n- Include chemical name and other details for ligands\n- Indicate funding sources; if your funding agency is not listed, select \u201cOther\u201d and provide details\n- For NMR structures, upload chemical shift files in NMR-STAR 3.1 format (concatenate multiple files if needed)\n- Ensure proper secondary structure annotation; wwPDB uses Promotif software integrated in Maxit (software link: https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html)\n- If your structure involves alternate configurations or microheterogeneity, assign unique residue numbers accordingly\n\n### Step 5: Monitor Validation Reports and Communication\n- After submission, validation reports become available in the Communication section of the deposition session\n- Use the latest validation report for making corrections\n- For issues with Free R test sets, incorrect TLS or ANISOU records, or others, consult the annotation help or contact wwPDB support via the communication tool\n\n### Step 6: Finalize and Release\n- Respond to any curation queries or necessary corrections\n- Confirm all required data and metadata are uploaded correctly\n- Release your structure entry for public availability when ready\n\n### Supporting Tools and Additional Notes\n- Use the SF-tool to generate mtz files with proper structure factor labels, facilitating map visualization in COOT\n- Microheterogeneity is handled by unique chain/residue identifiers and alternate conformation IDs as appropriate\n- If depositing EM structures, atomic coordinates must be accompanied by the associated EM map ID\n- The wwPDB validation service and OneDep system are separate; validation IDs cannot be used for deposition (start a new session at OneDep)\n- Consult wwPDB documentation and FAQs at http://www.wwpdb.org for detailed guidelines and policies\n\n---\n\n**Knowledge Base Sources Referenced**: [ID:1] [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n```",

Currently, password changes are not supported, but an ORCID-based authentication system is being implemented for future use.\n   - For new depositions, create a new session in OneDep at https://deposit.wwpdb.org.\n\n2. **Prepare Your Files**\n\n   - **Coordinate Files:** Typically in mmCIF or PDB format.\n   - **Experimental Data:** For X-ray crystallography, provide structure factor files (.mtz). For NMR, provide chemical shift files in NMR-STAR 3.1 format. For Electron Microscopy (EM), maps in CCP4 or MRC format.\n   - If you have multiple data sets (e.g., MAD data), provide all data sets with the refinement data listed first.\n   - Use the **SF-tool** or `pdb_extract` program for processing files with multiple data blocks or to generate mmCIF files with separate X-ray and Neutron data blocks.\n   - For very large files (>3GB), use Box file sharing or request FTP access through the communication page for upload.\n\n3. **Upload Files**\n\n   - Only upload files compressed with `.gz` extensions; mixing `.zip` or `.xz` files is not supported.\n   - Assign the correct file types during upload to avoid errors.\n   - If uploads fail, try starting a new session, change browser or network, and ensure files have proper permissions.\n   - For coordinate files with multiple models (NMR ensembles), ensure models are homogeneous with respect to atoms, sequence, and chemistry.\n\n4. **Provide Metadata**\n\n   - Provide descriptive entry titles reflecting the content.\n   - Provide chemical structural information about ligands, including SMILES strings or images showing atom types and bonding details.\n   - For special cases such as polymers with microheterogeneity, use appropriate residue numbering and alternate conformation identifiers as per the guidelines.\n   - Enter funding source information; if your funding organization is not listed, select \u201cOther\u201d and enter details manually.\n   - ORCID identifiers are mandatory for contact authors and encouraged for structure authors.\n  \n5. **Review Validation Reports**\n\n   - Validation reports are generated and accessible in the communication section of your deposition session.\n   - Address any issues flagged, such as incorrect Free R test sets, missing TLS records if ANISOU is present, or incorrect ligand modeling.\n   - For structural validation (e.g., Ramachandran angles), use the wwPDB validation server and update your model accordingly.\n\n6. **Release and Post-processing**\n\n   - Once the deposition is finalized and validated, you can request release.\n   - Minor changes post-submission can be made by staff if necessary.\n   - Coordinate with annotation staff as needed via the OneDep communication system.\n\n7. **Additional Tools and Resources**\n\n   - To calculate maps for model building in COOT, use the SF-tool to generate MTZ files with phases and coefficients.\n   - Use `pdb_extract` for more advanced structure factor processing.\n   - For secondary structure information, Promotif software integrated into Maxit is used for annotation; you can download from https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html if you wish to prepare your own secondary structure data.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Use Only .gz Files:** Only gzipped files are accepted for upload.\n- **Session Expiry:** Unsubmitted sessions are deleted after 3 months of inactivity with no recovery.\n- **Ligand Information:** Provide clear ligand structure and function details with your submission.\n- **Microheterogeneity:** Use alternate conformations or residue numbers as per ligand or polymer status.\n- **Map-only Depositions:** If depositing only EM maps or experimental data without coordinates, select \"No, experimental data only\" during deposition.\n- **Communication:** Use the OneDep communication tool for correspondence, especially if your entry corresponds to PDBe or PDBj servers.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table of Key URLs and Tools\n\n| Purpose                              | URL / Command                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| OneDep Deposition System            | https://deposit.wwpdb.org                                                                            |\n| SF-tool for Structure Factor Processing | http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org/                                                                           |\n| pdb_extract Program                 | http://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/PDB_EXTRACT/source.html                                                |\n| Maxit Software for Secondary Structure | https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html                                                     |\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- Deposition system login and password instructions and ORCID info [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n- Data preparation guidelines including MAD and NMR details, map and coordinate handling [ID:0]\n- File upload instructions and common upload issues [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n- Ligand structure submission information [ID:1]\n- Validation and post-deposition workflows [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5]\n\n---\n\nIf you need further assistance with the deposition process, consult the wwPDB help-desk or use OneDep communication after starting your deposition.  \n\n**The answer you are looking for is not found in the knowledge base!** (If you require further procedural details beyond those included here.)",

However, based on available information relevant to depositions, the following points can guide you through the process and considerations:\n\n### General Considerations for Deposition\n\n- **Login:** Use your Deposition ID (starting with D_) as the login, not the PDB ID. Passwords are shared among contact authors currently, and ORCID-based login is being implemented but not yet mandatory for all depositors.\n\n- **File Uploads:**  \n  - Only `.gz` compressed files are supported; mixing `.zip`, `.xz`, or other file types in the same session is not allowed.  \n  - Large files (>3GB) should preferably be uploaded via Box or FTP (available upon request).\n\n- **Experimental Data:**  \n  - If depositing only experimental data without coordinates (e.g., map-only depositions), start a new deposition and select the option \"No, experimental data only.\"\n\n- **Chemical Shift Files for NMR:**  \n  - When submitting chemical shift data, files should be in NMR-STAR 3.1 format. Multiple chemical shift files can be combined by adding `save_assigned_chemical_shifts_1/2` to each `.str` file and concatenating them before deposition.\n\n- **Ligand Information:**  \n  - Provide detailed chemical name/structure of any ligand before binding, including SMILES strings or web links to images if possible.\n\n- **Microheterogeneity in Polymers and Ligands:**  \n  - Use alternate conformation IDs to indicate multiple occupancies of the same chemical entity. Different chemical entities (e.g., enantiomers) must have unique residue numbers even if they overlap spatially.\n\n- **Secondary Structure:**  \n  - If you want to preserve secondary structure information after processing, communicate with curators to incorporate your secondary structural elements.\n\n- **Metadata and Validation:**  \n  - Include all relevant metadata (e.g., synchrotron source, wavelength for X-ray, NMR details) for validation.  \n  - Validation is performed separately through the wwPDB Validation Service; once ready, start a OneDep deposition session for your structure.\n\n### Tools and Software\n\n- **SF-tool:** Useful for preparing structure factor files required for diffraction-based methods.  \n- **pdb_extract Program:** Available for processing multiple data blocks and converting to mmCIF format.\n\n### Support and Communication\n\n- Use the OneDep system for deposition and related communications.  \n- For PDBe or PDBj managed entries (IDs starting with D_12... or D_13...), communicate through OneDep communication tools, not email.\n\n---\n\nSince detailed stepwise instructions are not directly provided in the knowledge base, you may refer to the OneDep deposition system at [http://deposit.wwpdb.org](http://deposit.wwpdb.org), which manages depositions across wwPDB partners including RCSB PDB.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Prepare all necessary files (coordinates, structure factors, NMR chemical shifts, ligand info).  \n- Use supported file formats (.gz compression recommended).  \n- Submit via the OneDep deposition portal with your Deposition ID.  \n- Provide complete metadata and experimental details.  \n- Use the Communication tool within OneDep for assistance and updates.\n\n---\n\n**The answer you are looking for is not found in the knowledge base!**\n\n[ID:1] [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5]\n```",

Here are the key steps and considerations based on the knowledge base:\n\n### 1. Start a New Deposition Session\n- Visit the OneDep deposition portal at: [http://deposit.wwpdb.org](http://deposit.wwpdb.org)\n- Use your **Deposition ID (starting with D_)** for login; this is provided after creating an account or starting a deposition.\n- ORCID-based login is being implemented for improved identity management.\n- Note: Passwords are shared among all contact authors and there is currently no mechanism for individual password changes.\n\n### 2. Prepare Your Files\n- Upload structure coordinate files in accepted formats (typically mmCIF).\n- Upload experimental data files as needed (e.g., structure factors for X-ray, chemical shift files for NMR).\n- Only .gz compressed files are accepted for uploads if compressing files; mixing .zip, .xz, and .gz in one session is not allowed.\n- For files larger than 3GB, use Box file sharing or request FTP access via the Communication page.\n- For multi-method or joint methods (e.g., X-ray and Neutron), use tools like the SF-tool or pdb_extract to prepare the proper mmCIF data blocks.\n\n### 3. Provide Required Metadata\n- Include experimental details such as method, source, wavelength, and refinement information.\n- For ligands, provide chemical structure details before binding, including SMILE strings or image URLs.\n- Include polymer sequence data, microheterogeneity details, and alternate conformations if applicable.\n- Specify funding organizations; if your funding source is not listed, select \"Other\" and enter the details.\n- Provide ORCID IDs for all contact authors (mandatory) and encourage structure authors to obtain ORCIDs.\n\n### 4. Validation and Correction\n- The OneDep system performs validation checks on submitted data.\n- Address any issues reported by the validation server before final submission.\n- For NMR entries, submit chemical shift files in NMR-STAR 3.1 format; combine multiple files by adding specific tags as per instructions.\n\n### 5. Use the Communication Tool\n- The Communication tool within OneDep allows you to correspond with annotation staff.\n- For depositions managed by PDBe or PDBj (entries with IDs starting D_12xxxxxx or D_13xxxxxx), use OneDep Communication rather than email.\n\n### 6. Complete and Release the Entry\n- Submit your entry after validation and final checks.\n- Note: Unsubmitted sessions will be deleted after 3 months of inactivity.\n- After release, public access to entry, metadata, and validation reports will be available.\n  \n### Additional Notes:\n- Depositions can include combined data sets (e.g., X-ray, neutron) and multiple data types (coordinates, maps).\n- For map-only deposits (e.g., EM data only), select the option \"No, experimental data only\" during deposition.\n- If you encounter issues (e.g., ligand analysis failure, validation problems), consult the help-desk or use Communication within OneDep.\n- For specific technical steps and tools:\n  - Use [SF-tool](http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org/) for preparing structure factor files.\n  - Use [pdb_extract](http://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/PDB_EXTRACT/source.html) to convert and prepare mmCIF files.\n- For secondary structure annotation, the PDB uses an in-house version of Promotif integrated with Maxit, downloadable from [https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html](https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html).\n\n### Summary Table of Basic Submission Workflow\n\n| Step                          | Description                                          |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Create/login to OneDep         | Use deposition ID and password or ORCID            |\n| Upload Files                  | Coordinate, experimental data (.cif, .str, etc.)    |\n| Provide Metadata             | Experimental method, ligand info, funding, authors |\n| Validate and Correct Errors  | Use validation reports and resolve issues           |\n| Use Communication Tool       | For exchange with annotation staff                  |\n| Final Submission & Release   | Submit for public release                            |\n\n---\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use the OneDep system for deposition.\n- Prepare all required files in accepted formats; use tools like SF-tool and pdb_extract if necessary.\n- ORCID is mandatory for contact authors.\n- Use the Communication tool for queries during deposition.\n- Large files and map-only deposits require special handling.\n- Validation reports guide corrections prior to final submission.\n\n### References:\nAvailable reference IDs: [ID:1] [ID:2] [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n\n```",
