The process includes preparing your coordinate files, experimental data (if any), ligand information, and annotations, and then uploading these through the OneDep deposition interface following the validation and annotation guidelines.\n\n## Detailed Information\n\n### Submission System and IDs\n- Depositions to RCSB PDB are done via the OneDep system at https://deposit.wwpdb.org.\n- Your login uses a **deposition ID** (starting with 'D_\u2026'), not a PDB ID.\n- Passwords are shared among all contact authors of the deposition.\n- ORCID login is being introduced but is not mandatory yet; ORCID is mandatory for contact authors.\n\n### Required Information and Files\n- Provide your **coordinate files**, typically in PDB or mmCIF format.\n- If X-ray or Neutron crystallography data is used, structure factor (SF) files are necessary. Use tools like the **SF-tool** (http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org) or **pdb_extract** to prepare combined SF files if you have multiple data sets (e.g., X-ray + Neutron).\n- For NMR structures, provide chemical shift files in **NMR-STAR 3.1 format**.\n- Include **ligand chemical information**, such as chemical structures (SMILE strings or images), binding mode details, and molecular function (inhibitor, substrate, etc.).\n- For Electron Microscopy (EM) structures, maps can be deposited in CCP4 or MRC format, with required metadata like voxel size and contour levels.\n- Provide metadata about experimental methods, authors, funding sources (select from existing lists or specify \"Other\" if not present).\n- Ensure alternate conformations and microheterogeneity are properly annotated.\n\n### Deposition Process Highlights\n- Upload files only in supported formats (e.g., .gz compressed files; note that mixing .gz, .zip, and .xz files in one deposition session is not allowed).\n- Follow instructions for polymer chain IDs, alternate conformations, and residue numbering for chemical entities.\n- If your structure involves TLS refinement, provide TLS records or conduct refinement without TLS if missing.\n- For water molecules on special positions, set occupancies according to multiplicity.\n- Provide all relevant metadata for validation (e.g., experimental details, synchrotron source information).\n- Validation reports will be available through the Communication section of OneDep during deposition.\n\n### Handling Large Files and Session Management\n- Files larger than 3GB should be uploaded via Box or FTP upon request.\n- Unsubmitted deposition sessions are deleted after 3 months of inactivity and cannot be recovered.\n- Use the OneDep **Communication Tool** to interact with annotation staff and resolve any validation or processing queries.\n\n### Useful Links and Tools\n- OneDep system for deposition: https://deposit.wwpdb.org\n- SF-tool for structure factor files: http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org\n- pdb_extract for data block processing: http://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/PDB_EXTRACT/source.html\n- For guidance on secondary structure and annotations, see software recommendations and contact support as needed.\n\n### Summary of Key Steps\n1. Prepare coordinate files (PDB/mmCIF) and experimental data files.\n2. Prepare ligand chemical information and metadata.\n3. Log in with your deposition ID at OneDep deposition system.\n4. Upload your data files following guided steps.\n5. Validate structure and data through OneDep\u2019s validation tools.\n6. Respond to any annotations or validation issues via Communication Tool.\n7. Finalize submission; depositions receive IDs in the appropriate range for RCSB PDB (e.g., D_10002\u2026 series).\n\n---\n\n**Knowledge Base Sources Referenced**: [ID:1] [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n```",

Specific file types, data formatting, and procedures must be followed as per wwPDB requirements. Additional helpful tools such as SF-tool and pdb_extract exist for preparing structure factor files. Login credentials are based on deposition IDs, and ORCID is mandatory for all contact authors. For large files or special cases, Box or FTP can be used.\n\n## Detailed Information\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Files\n- Coordinate files (e.g., PDB or mmCIF)\n- Experimental data such as structure factors (SF file), NMR chemical shifts, or EM maps\n- Ligand details including chemical structures and binding mode information if applicable\n- Metadata including authorship (mandatory ORCID for contact authors), funding sources, and experimental details\n\n### Step 2: Access the OneDep Deposition System\n- Login using your deposition ID (e.g., D_\u2026) as login credential; password is shared among contact authors\n- ORCID login is also supported for depositors with ORCID IDs\n- There is currently no mechanism to change passwords (use ORCID login when possible)\n\n### Step 3: Upload Required Files\n- Files must be uploaded in supported formats, such as .gz compressed files; mixing .gz with .zip or .xz in the same session is not supported\n- For structure factor files, SF-tool (http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org/) or pdb_extract utility can be used to prepare correct mmCIF or mtz files containing separate X-ray and neutron data blocks if applicable\n- For large files (>3GB), use Box platform or request FTP upload access through the communication page in the deposition interface\n\n### Step 4: Provide Metadata and Annotation\n- Provide a descriptive title for the structure entry\n- Include chemical name and other details for ligands\n- Indicate funding sources; if your funding agency is not listed, select \u201cOther\u201d and provide details\n- For NMR structures, upload chemical shift files in NMR-STAR 3.1 format (concatenate multiple files if needed)\n- Ensure proper secondary structure annotation; wwPDB uses Promotif software integrated in Maxit (software link: https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html)\n- If your structure involves alternate configurations or microheterogeneity, assign unique residue numbers accordingly\n\n### Step 5: Monitor Validation Reports and Communication\n- After submission, validation reports become available in the Communication section of the deposition session\n- Use the latest validation report for making corrections\n- For issues with Free R test sets, incorrect TLS or ANISOU records, or others, consult the annotation help or contact wwPDB support via the communication tool\n\n### Step 6: Finalize and Release\n- Respond to any curation queries or necessary corrections\n- Confirm all required data and metadata are uploaded correctly\n- Release your structure entry for public availability when ready\n\n### Supporting Tools and Additional Notes\n- Use the SF-tool to generate mtz files with proper structure factor labels, facilitating map visualization in COOT\n- Microheterogeneity is handled by unique chain/residue identifiers and alternate conformation IDs as appropriate\n- If depositing EM structures, atomic coordinates must be accompanied by the associated EM map ID\n- The wwPDB validation service and OneDep system are separate; validation IDs cannot be used for deposition (start a new session at OneDep)\n- Consult wwPDB documentation and FAQs at http://www.wwpdb.org for detailed guidelines and policies\n\n---\n\n**Knowledge Base Sources Referenced**: [ID:1] [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n```",

Currently, password changes are not supported, but an ORCID-based authentication system is being implemented for future use.\n   - For new depositions, create a new session in OneDep at https://deposit.wwpdb.org.\n\n2. **Prepare Your Files**\n\n   - **Coordinate Files:** Typically in mmCIF or PDB format.\n   - **Experimental Data:** For X-ray crystallography, provide structure factor files (.mtz). For NMR, provide chemical shift files in NMR-STAR 3.1 format. For Electron Microscopy (EM), maps in CCP4 or MRC format.\n   - If you have multiple data sets (e.g., MAD data), provide all data sets with the refinement data listed first.\n   - Use the **SF-tool** or `pdb_extract` program for processing files with multiple data blocks or to generate mmCIF files with separate X-ray and Neutron data blocks.\n   - For very large files (>3GB), use Box file sharing or request FTP access through the communication page for upload.\n\n3. **Upload Files**\n\n   - Only upload files compressed with `.gz` extensions; mixing `.zip` or `.xz` files is not supported.\n   - Assign the correct file types during upload to avoid errors.\n   - If uploads fail, try starting a new session, change browser or network, and ensure files have proper permissions.\n   - For coordinate files with multiple models (NMR ensembles), ensure models are homogeneous with respect to atoms, sequence, and chemistry.\n\n4. **Provide Metadata**\n\n   - Provide descriptive entry titles reflecting the content.\n   - Provide chemical structural information about ligands, including SMILES strings or images showing atom types and bonding details.\n   - For special cases such as polymers with microheterogeneity, use appropriate residue numbering and alternate conformation identifiers as per the guidelines.\n   - Enter funding source information; if your funding organization is not listed, select \u201cOther\u201d and enter details manually.\n   - ORCID identifiers are mandatory for contact authors and encouraged for structure authors.\n  \n5. **Review Validation Reports**\n\n   - Validation reports are generated and accessible in the communication section of your deposition session.\n   - Address any issues flagged, such as incorrect Free R test sets, missing TLS records if ANISOU is present, or incorrect ligand modeling.\n   - For structural validation (e.g., Ramachandran angles), use the wwPDB validation server and update your model accordingly.\n\n6. **Release and Post-processing**\n\n   - Once the deposition is finalized and validated, you can request release.\n   - Minor changes post-submission can be made by staff if necessary.\n   - Coordinate with annotation staff as needed via the OneDep communication system.\n\n7. **Additional Tools and Resources**\n\n   - To calculate maps for model building in COOT, use the SF-tool to generate MTZ files with phases and coefficients.\n   - Use `pdb_extract` for more advanced structure factor processing.\n   - For secondary structure information, Promotif software integrated into Maxit is used for annotation; you can download from https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html if you wish to prepare your own secondary structure data.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Use Only .gz Files:** Only gzipped files are accepted for upload.\n- **Session Expiry:** Unsubmitted sessions are deleted after 3 months of inactivity with no recovery.\n- **Ligand Information:** Provide clear ligand structure and function details with your submission.\n- **Microheterogeneity:** Use alternate conformations or residue numbers as per ligand or polymer status.\n- **Map-only Depositions:** If depositing only EM maps or experimental data without coordinates, select \"No, experimental data only\" during deposition.\n- **Communication:** Use the OneDep communication tool for correspondence, especially if your entry corresponds to PDBe or PDBj servers.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table of Key URLs and Tools\n\n| Purpose                              | URL / Command                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| OneDep Deposition System            | https://deposit.wwpdb.org                                                                            |\n| SF-tool for Structure Factor Processing | http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org/                                                                           |\n| pdb_extract Program                 | http://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/PDB_EXTRACT/source.html                                                |\n| Maxit Software for Secondary Structure | https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html                                                     |\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- Deposition system login and password instructions and ORCID info [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n- Data preparation guidelines including MAD and NMR details, map and coordinate handling [ID:0]\n- File upload instructions and common upload issues [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n- Ligand structure submission information [ID:1]\n- Validation and post-deposition workflows [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5]\n\n---\n\nIf you need further assistance with the deposition process, consult the wwPDB help-desk or use OneDep communication after starting your deposition.  \n\n**The answer you are looking for is not found in the knowledge base!** (If you require further procedural details beyond those included here.)",

However, based on available information relevant to depositions, the following points can guide you through the process and considerations:\n\n### General Considerations for Deposition\n\n- **Login:** Use your Deposition ID (starting with D_) as the login, not the PDB ID. Passwords are shared among contact authors currently, and ORCID-based login is being implemented but not yet mandatory for all depositors.\n\n- **File Uploads:**  \n  - Only `.gz` compressed files are supported; mixing `.zip`, `.xz`, or other file types in the same session is not allowed.  \n  - Large files (>3GB) should preferably be uploaded via Box or FTP (available upon request).\n\n- **Experimental Data:**  \n  - If depositing only experimental data without coordinates (e.g., map-only depositions), start a new deposition and select the option \"No, experimental data only.\"\n\n- **Chemical Shift Files for NMR:**  \n  - When submitting chemical shift data, files should be in NMR-STAR 3.1 format. Multiple chemical shift files can be combined by adding `save_assigned_chemical_shifts_1/2` to each `.str` file and concatenating them before deposition.\n\n- **Ligand Information:**  \n  - Provide detailed chemical name/structure of any ligand before binding, including SMILES strings or web links to images if possible.\n\n- **Microheterogeneity in Polymers and Ligands:**  \n  - Use alternate conformation IDs to indicate multiple occupancies of the same chemical entity. Different chemical entities (e.g., enantiomers) must have unique residue numbers even if they overlap spatially.\n\n- **Secondary Structure:**  \n  - If you want to preserve secondary structure information after processing, communicate with curators to incorporate your secondary structural elements.\n\n- **Metadata and Validation:**  \n  - Include all relevant metadata (e.g., synchrotron source, wavelength for X-ray, NMR details) for validation.  \n  - Validation is performed separately through the wwPDB Validation Service; once ready, start a OneDep deposition session for your structure.\n\n### Tools and Software\n\n- **SF-tool:** Useful for preparing structure factor files required for diffraction-based methods.  \n- **pdb_extract Program:** Available for processing multiple data blocks and converting to mmCIF format.\n\n### Support and Communication\n\n- Use the OneDep system for deposition and related communications.  \n- For PDBe or PDBj managed entries (IDs starting with D_12... or D_13...), communicate through OneDep communication tools, not email.\n\n---\n\nSince detailed stepwise instructions are not directly provided in the knowledge base, you may refer to the OneDep deposition system at [http://deposit.wwpdb.org](http://deposit.wwpdb.org), which manages depositions across wwPDB partners including RCSB PDB.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Prepare all necessary files (coordinates, structure factors, NMR chemical shifts, ligand info).  \n- Use supported file formats (.gz compression recommended).  \n- Submit via the OneDep deposition portal with your Deposition ID.  \n- Provide complete metadata and experimental details.  \n- Use the Communication tool within OneDep for assistance and updates.\n\n---\n\n**The answer you are looking for is not found in the knowledge base!**\n\n[ID:1] [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5]\n```",

Here are the key steps and considerations based on the knowledge base:\n\n### 1. Start a New Deposition Session\n- Visit the OneDep deposition portal at: [http://deposit.wwpdb.org](http://deposit.wwpdb.org)\n- Use your **Deposition ID (starting with D_)** for login; this is provided after creating an account or starting a deposition.\n- ORCID-based login is being implemented for improved identity management.\n- Note: Passwords are shared among all contact authors and there is currently no mechanism for individual password changes.\n\n### 2. Prepare Your Files\n- Upload structure coordinate files in accepted formats (typically mmCIF).\n- Upload experimental data files as needed (e.g., structure factors for X-ray, chemical shift files for NMR).\n- Only .gz compressed files are accepted for uploads if compressing files; mixing .zip, .xz, and .gz in one session is not allowed.\n- For files larger than 3GB, use Box file sharing or request FTP access via the Communication page.\n- For multi-method or joint methods (e.g., X-ray and Neutron), use tools like the SF-tool or pdb_extract to prepare the proper mmCIF data blocks.\n\n### 3. Provide Required Metadata\n- Include experimental details such as method, source, wavelength, and refinement information.\n- For ligands, provide chemical structure details before binding, including SMILE strings or image URLs.\n- Include polymer sequence data, microheterogeneity details, and alternate conformations if applicable.\n- Specify funding organizations; if your funding source is not listed, select \"Other\" and enter the details.\n- Provide ORCID IDs for all contact authors (mandatory) and encourage structure authors to obtain ORCIDs.\n\n### 4. Validation and Correction\n- The OneDep system performs validation checks on submitted data.\n- Address any issues reported by the validation server before final submission.\n- For NMR entries, submit chemical shift files in NMR-STAR 3.1 format; combine multiple files by adding specific tags as per instructions.\n\n### 5. Use the Communication Tool\n- The Communication tool within OneDep allows you to correspond with annotation staff.\n- For depositions managed by PDBe or PDBj (entries with IDs starting D_12xxxxxx or D_13xxxxxx), use OneDep Communication rather than email.\n\n### 6. Complete and Release the Entry\n- Submit your entry after validation and final checks.\n- Note: Unsubmitted sessions will be deleted after 3 months of inactivity.\n- After release, public access to entry, metadata, and validation reports will be available.\n  \n### Additional Notes:\n- Depositions can include combined data sets (e.g., X-ray, neutron) and multiple data types (coordinates, maps).\n- For map-only deposits (e.g., EM data only), select the option \"No, experimental data only\" during deposition.\n- If you encounter issues (e.g., ligand analysis failure, validation problems), consult the help-desk or use Communication within OneDep.\n- For specific technical steps and tools:\n  - Use [SF-tool](http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org/) for preparing structure factor files.\n  - Use [pdb_extract](http://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/PDB_EXTRACT/source.html) to convert and prepare mmCIF files.\n- For secondary structure annotation, the PDB uses an in-house version of Promotif integrated with Maxit, downloadable from [https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html](https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html).\n\n### Summary Table of Basic Submission Workflow\n\n| Step                          | Description                                          |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Create/login to OneDep         | Use deposition ID and password or ORCID            |\n| Upload Files                  | Coordinate, experimental data (.cif, .str, etc.)    |\n| Provide Metadata             | Experimental method, ligand info, funding, authors |\n| Validate and Correct Errors  | Use validation reports and resolve issues           |\n| Use Communication Tool       | For exchange with annotation staff                  |\n| Final Submission & Release   | Submit for public release                            |\n\n---\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use the OneDep system for deposition.\n- Prepare all required files in accepted formats; use tools like SF-tool and pdb_extract if necessary.\n- ORCID is mandatory for contact authors.\n- Use the Communication tool for queries during deposition.\n- Large files and map-only deposits require special handling.\n- Validation reports guide corrections prior to final submission.\n\n### References:\nAvailable reference IDs: [ID:1] [ID:2] [ID:3] [ID:4] [ID:5] [ID:6]\n\n```",

However, it has limitations in handling complex structures, especially those with intricate beta sheet topologies or entries containing more than 99,999 ATOM lines.\n\nTo address these limitations, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) primarily processes and archives macromolecular structure data in the more advanced and extensible **PDBx/mmCIF** format. This newer format can accurately represent large and complex structures that are incompatible with the legacy PDB format.\n\nFor structures that cannot be represented in the legacy PDB file format (e.g., those with multiple character chain IDs or more than 62 chains), single mmCIF files are used to represent the entire structure. Additionally, TAR files containing collections of minimal or best-effort PDB-format files may be provided to support users and software tools reliant on the older PDB file format. In such cases, a flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` is set to \"N\" within the mmCIF files to indicate incompatibility with full representation in PDB format.\n\nThe wwPDB no longer produces full PDB-format files for entries with complex beta sheet topologies since June 2021; instead, all structural details are fully captured in mmCIF files.\n\nChain IDs in PDB-format files have restrictions: they must be single characters using upper- or lower-case letters and numbers without symbols. The wwPDB encourages sequential residue numbering aligned with UniProt where possible to maintain clarity and consistency.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The **legacy PDB file format** is limited by fixed-width columns restricting atom counts and chain ID complexity.\n- The **PDBx/mmCIF** format overcomes these limitations by supporting larger structures and richer metadata.\n- For backward compatibility, minimal PDB-format files may accompany mmCIF deposits but do not capture all details.\n- The flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` indicates whether an entry can be fully represented in legacy PDB format (\"Y\") or not (\"N\").\n\n### Key Points:\n- Legacy **PDB file format** has size and complexity limits (e.g., max ~99,999 atoms).\n- wwPDB uses **PDBx/mmCIF** as primary archival standard for complex/large structures.\n- Structures incompatible with legacy formats get a \"not compatible\" flag (`_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible = N`).\n- Minimal sets of traditional-format files may be provided alongside mmCIF for software compatibility.\n- Chain IDs must be alphanumeric single characters; non-symbols only.\n- Sequential residue numbering encouraged following UniProt standards.\n\n### References:\n[ID:1] [ID:3] [ID:5]\n```",

To ensure that all wwPDB and related deposition tools function with minimal loss of data fidelity,depositors should output PDBx/mmCIF format files from their refinement program, if supported. A PDBx/mmCIF preparation guide is available. The format requirements for depositing structures are as follows: Coordinates and meta-data PDBx/mmCIF format: Deposition can be prepared in PDBx/mmCIF exchange format. Definitions and dictionary are available in HTML, ASCII, and XML format (see PDB format: Definitions and format content guide are available in PDF and HTMLformat (see http://wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format for details).Structure factorsThe structure factor file can either be in mmCIF or mtz formats and should include h,k, l, F, SigmaF (and/or I and SigmaI)and test flags.

For these large or complex entries, single mmCIF files represent the entire structure, accompanied by TAR files containing minimal PDB-format files for compatibility with software reliant on the older format. In such cases, the mmCIF flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` is set to \"N\".\n\nHeader keywords (_struct_keywds.pdbx_keywords) assign a broad functional descriptor to each entry, chosen by annotators after reviewing UniProt and author-provided keywords. A standard list of headers, detailed in Appendix A and available online, guides these assignments. If the protein is an enzyme, the header reflects its enzyme class based on the E.C. number; unknown or putative functions use \"UNKNOWN FUNCTION\" or the putative class name. When multiple functions apply, headers are combined with a forward slash (e.g., TRANSCRIPTION/DNA), with \"complex\" noted in keywords but not in the header record itself.\n\nThe annotation process includes a detailed audit trail of revisions with categories such as structure model, database references, and source taxonomy, tracked down to minor and major revisions with dates. Related entries are linked via the pdbx_database_related category, indicating reuse or re-refinement of previous experimental data. For example, entry 1ZET is a re-refinement of data originally from 1T3N, with the re-refinement documented in REMARK 0 and associated citations maintained.\n\nLINK records describing covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide bonds (SSBOND) are generated automatically based on standard cutoff distances; authors may also add such records. The struct_conn category captures precise link details, including atom identifiers and distances. From June 2021, PDB-format files are no longer produced for entries with complex beta sheet topologies, but these are fully captured in mmCIF files.\n\nSecondary structure elements like helices and sheets are identified automatically by the Promotif algorithm and recorded in multiple categories (e.g., struct_conf, struct_sheet, pdbx_struct_sheet_hbond), though authors may supply their own annotations if desired.\n\nValidation includes bond length and angle deviation calculations using updated Engh & Huber parameters for proteins and Parkinson et al. statistics for nucleic acids, flagging deviations greater than six standard deviations. Backbone angles (PHI/PSI) are calculated per Kleywegt\u2019s methods. Validation results cover close contacts, symmetry-related contacts, bond lengths and angles, torsions, peptide bond conformations, planar groups, main chain planarity, and chirality, documented in specific mmCIF validation categories and REMARK 500.\n\nAdditional entry details, such as compound functional information (REMARK 400), polymer sequence details (REMARK 999), and ligand data (REMARK 600), are annotated under _pdbx_entry_details. Deprecated SITE records (_struct_site) are no longer used.\n\nThe wwPDB\u2019s processing procedures have evolved since 1999, with multiple updates to address new scientific methods, enhance annotation quality, and incorporate emerging standards such as reserved ligand IDs, chain ID policies for cleaved polymers, and biological assembly annotations. The current version (4.5, March 2025) documents all procedures, with versions and file format compliance clearly indicated in released files.\n\nIn summary, the wwPDB ensures high-quality, standardized macromolecular data deposition and annotation through rigorous header assignment, comprehensive audit tracking, detailed link and secondary structure annotation, thorough validation metrics, and careful legacy data integration, all centered on the robust and extensible mmCIF format.",

Authors review and approve curated entries before release; if no response is received within three weeks after validation, and no issues exist, entries are deemed approved. Entries are released once the associated publication is available. Authors may withdraw unreleased entries before publication, with withdrawn entries retained in the archive with status WDRN. Problematic entries (e.g., unusual chemistry, bond lengths, sequence mismatches) are discussed with authors; unresolved issues lead to withdrawal after a one-year hold unless a publication appears, in which case the entry is released with a caveat.\n\nCoordinate and experimental data files share the same release status and are released simultaneously. Entries are processed and released on a weekly schedule according to three statuses: REL (immediate release after approval), HPUB (held until publication or one year from deposition), or HOLD (held up to one year). Authors must submit release requests and corrections by Thursday noon local time; late requests are processed in the next cycle. Released data are packaged by RCSB-PDB and synchronized weekly among wwPDB FTP sites. On Saturdays, new entries\u2019 sequence, ligand InChI strings, and crystallization pH are posted online; updates occur Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC.\n\nUnreleased data are accessible only to authors; some metadata (title, authorship, sample sequences) may be publicly available with permission. Reviewers and journal referees do not have access to unreleased data but are encouraged to request wwPDB validation reports. If no author response occurs within three weeks and no issues exist, REL entries are released; entries with issues follow the Problem Structures policy. HPUB and HOLD entries can be held a maximum of one year from deposition; after ten months, wwPDB contacts authors regarding release or withdrawal decisions.\n\nPDB IDs and ligand codes are automatically assigned at deposition completion; they cannot be requested or reserved and may be changed by wwPDB. Before release, authors may update coordinates, experimental data, and header information anytime. Once marked for release, revisions can be submitted until the established deadline. After release, minor updates (e.g., citation, author name, or file format corrections) and major revisions (coordinate replacements, chemical composition changes, chain IDs, sequence modifications) are possible through depositor- or wwPDB-initiated updates, managed via the PDB archival versioning system.",

HEADER assignment How is the header keyword (_struct_keywds.pdbx_keywords)record assigned? One keyword is used to briefly describe the broad function of the macromolecules present inthe PDB entry. A list of classifications is available at the end of this document and at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/class.dat. Header functions are assigned by the annotator The annotator typically assigns the function after reviewing the UniProt keywords and keywords provided by the author. The annotated header will also be included in the entrykeywords (_struct_keywords.text)and if the header is a complex (/separated), the word\u2018complex\u2019will be added in the keywords. If protein is an enzyme, the general class of enzymes is used. For example, the header is assigned as oxidoreductase if the E.C. numberstarts with 1. See Appendix A or ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/class.dat for the list of available headers.If protein has no known function, \"UNKNOWN FUNCTION\"is used.If the function is putative, such as a \"putative hydrolase\"the header will be assigned based on the putative assignment, i.e., \"HYDROLASE\". If the annotator is unsure of the function, the annotator asks the author to choose theappropriate header from within the standard header list.If the function is new to the PDB, a generalized header describing the function will be added to the standard header list.Two or more HEADERs can be combined using the following rules:For macromolecular complexes, the headers are separated with a forward slash (HEADER1/HEADER2). e.g., TRANSCRIPTION/DNA (Note that protein is listed first in protein/nucleic acid complexes).The word \"complex\"will not be used in the header record but will appear in the ",

It covers diverse experimental methods\u2014X-ray crystallography, NMR, electron microscopy/electron crystallography (3DEM/EC), viral capsid assemblies, structural genomics\u2014and details data formatting, metadata, and validation requirements to ensure scientific reliability and usability.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Crystallographic Reflection Data:**  \n   Examples illustrate mmCIF formatting for reflection data across single and multiple refinement data sets, with precise unit cell parameters (e.g., a=118.86 \u00c5, b=155.03 \u00c5, space group C 2 2 21, wavelength 0.98100 \u00c5) and reflection counts (e.g., ~28,813 reflections from 1.769 to 19.546 \u00c5 resolution). Standards require proper annotation in mmCIF categories (_refln, _phasing_set_refln), preservation of author-supplied significant figures and hydrogen occupancies, automated calculation of Matthews coefficient and solvent content, and twinning annotations.\n\n2. **Structural Types and Assemblies:**  \n   - *Viral Capsids:* Defined via non-crystallographic symmetry with deposits including asymmetric unit coordinates plus 60 transformation matrices aligned to ViperDB reference frames.  \n   - *NMR Structures:* Pseudoatoms removed pre-deposition; a single domain superposition model is used; ensembles deposited alongside a minimized average (MODEL 1).  \n   - *3DEM/EC:* Deposits include atomic coordinates linked to EMDB 3D density maps in CCP4 format (converted from MRC if necessary), covering multiple methods and map subtypes (primary, half maps, masks, optional). Extensive metadata on data collection and reconstruction is required.  \n   - *Structural Genomics:* Entries from global SG centers follow standard processing with additional project-specific annotations and generally immediate data release.  \n   - *X-ray Crystallography:* Complete asymmetric unit atomic coordinates plus detailed crystallographic parameters are mandatory. Twinned and multi-dataset (e.g., MAD) data sets are supported with specific annotation protocols.\n\n3. **File Formats and Validation:**  \n   The mmCIF format accommodates large and complex structures beyond legacy PDB limitations. Deposits include TARred minimal PDB files flagged as partially incompatible for legacy support. Structural features such as covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide links are auto-generated and recorded. Secondary structures are identified automatically with author override options. Validation encompasses bond geometry, torsions, and other metrics, highlighting deviations beyond six standard deviations.\n\n4. **Annotation Guidelines:**  \n   Titles must clearly describe structures; author attribution and formatting follow literature conventions. Macromolecule naming aligns with UniProt unless modified; expression and source organism annotations use NCBI/UniProt taxonomy with synthetic and chimeric designations. Polymer sequences must be complete, including tags and modifications but excluding cleaved residues. Enzyme Commission numbers and mutations are precisely annotated. Biological assemblies include both author and software-derived data, with rigorous nomenclature for oligomeric states and thermodynamic data. Chain IDs allow up to four alphanumeric characters with sequence numbering aligning to UniProt where possible; missing residues and atoms are carefully flagged with REMARK records. Alternate conformations and chemically modified residues follow stringent annotation rules. Ligands are annotated with identifiers (InChI, SMILES), linked to the wwPDB Chemical Component Dictionary, and managed to avoid duplication with temporary IDs. Peptide-like inhibitors are carefully classified; chemical correctness and stereochemical ambiguity are clearly flagged. Unknown residues use defined placeholder codes with restrictions.\n\n5. **Versioning and History:**  \n   Entries employ major-minor version numbering to track coordinate and metadata changes, preserving all historical data to maintain integrity and reproducibility. Audit trails record revisions, re-refinements, and related deposits with citations.\n\n6. **Additional Notes:**  \n   Legacy site records (_struct_site, _struct_site_gen) ceased generation as of June 2021, though existing data remain. Synonymous ligand names and chemical modifications are managed to ensure clarity. The Biologically Interesting molecule Reference Dictionary (BIRD) standardizes annotation for peptide-like antibiotics and inhibitors and is regularly updated.\n\nOverall, these detailed standards and protocols enable consistent, validated, and comprehensive archiving of macromolecular structures, facilitating reliable data sharing, reproducibility, and reuse within the scientific community via the extensible mmCIF format.",

How are chain IDs related to residue numbering? All residues and chemical groups in a file should be uniquely identified. Once the polymers and chemical groups associated with them are assigned chain IDs, the numbering of all residues, chemical groups and waters for each chain ID must be unique. Numbering of residues that were not modelled due to limited experimental data should also be consideredhere. The wwPDB encourages deposition of polymer chains with sequential residuenumbering. For protein chains, the authors are encouraged to follow the UniProt residue numbering, wherever possible. The use of non-sequential residue numbering and insertion codes should be avoided as much as possible in order to make structures easily interpretableby the larger scientific community. If the coordinate residue numbers, as provided by the author, are unique and sequential within a particular chain ID, the residues will not be renumbered. If the author has already correctly sorted ligands to polymer chains with whichthey are associated, these are not reassigned. How polymer chain IDs should be assigned?Upper-and lower-case letters, numbers (0-9)and a combination of these should be used forchain IDs. It is preferred that lower case letters and combination of letters/numbers are used after all upper letters and numbers have been used. Symbols should never be used for chain IDs.Consistent use of chain IDs in PDB structures and manuscripts During the annotation of structures, the numbering and chain IDs of the chemical groups and waters associated with the polymeric chains may be changed in accordance with the wwPDB chain ID rules. The wwPDB strongly encourages depositors to use the wwPDB-assigned chain ID and residue numbers in any publication material. Deposition and processing of structures prior to preparation of the manuscript will ensure consistent usage of chain IDs and residue numbers in the manuscript and the PDB file. Validation and structure analysis reports generated during annotation may also be helpful in the manuscript preparation.

              "content": "The provided text contains guidance and information on processing structural biology data files, validation, and deposition protocols primarily related to X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction, and NMR structures, along with references to specific software tools and resources.\n\n1. **Data File Conversion and Processing:**\n   - For joint X-ray and neutron structure factor (SF) files, the recommended tool is \"pdb_extract\" from the RCSB website; within it, 'sf_convert' is used to convert MTZ files to mmCIF format. Example commands include specifying multiple data sets separated by colons, where the second data block corresponds to neutron data.\n   - Alternatively, the SF-tool (http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org) can be used for semi-automatic MTZ-to-mmCIF conversion, supporting multiple data sets.\n   - SF-tool can also generate map coefficients (phi and amplitude) needed for visualization in COOT if missing from original SF files. The process involves uploading files or entering a PDB code, selecting \u201cX-ray data using Refmac,\u201d running the job, downloading the MTZ, then loading it in COOT.\n\n2. **Validation Issues and Reporting:**\n   - Free R flags in deposited data are sometimes incorrect if calculated Free R is lower than reported values and resembles working set R values. In such cases, a corrected structure factor file with appropriate Free R flags should be provided.\n   - wwPDB validation treats chemically distinct alternate conformations occupying the same space as different residues with unique residue numbers; however, for microheterogeneity (e.g., partial cysteine modifications), the same residue number is maintained.\n   - MolProbity adds hydrogen atoms during validation for a complete model, which can generate apparent hydrogen clashes in reports. Users are advised to inspect these areas carefully.\n   - NMR validation reports can be improved by following best practices and resources given at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25330971/ and wwPDB NMR validation help pages.\n\n3. **Secondary Structure Annotation:**\n   - The pdb_extract program does not retain secondary structure elements after processing. If the default DSSP assignment is unsatisfactory, users can request to incorporate their secondary structure annotations via wwPDB communication channels.\n   - Secondary structure annotation used by wwPDB is via an in-house implementation of Promotif, integrated into Maxit software (available at https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html).\n\n4. **NMR Data Deposition Notes:**\n   - Only chemical-shift-based NMR data with proper restraints are accepted by wwPDB; entries generated solely from chemical shifts or restraints-only (e.g., from CS-ROSETTA, HADDOCK, NMR2) should be submitted to PDB-Dev.\n   - To combine multiple chemical shift files into one for OneDep, add specific header lines (e.g., save_assigned_chemical_shifts_1 and _2) to each file and concatenate them.\n   - \"AMBER auxiliary coordinate files\" are used to number atoms for NMR restraints differently than atom names; tutorials for creating these files are available on the Amber MD website.\n   - The system currently recognizes only CIF, PDB, and STAR file formats, but warnings for other file formats can be ignored if appropriate.\n   - For generating NMR-STAR 3.1 formatted chemical shift files, BMRB provides tools such as STARch (https://bmrb.io/software/starch/) and template generators (https://bmrb.io/software/tablege/). Users are encouraged to use direct exports from software like NMRView or CCPN when possible to maintain data integrity.\n\n5. **Contacts and Help:**\n   - Questions about BMRB entries, report requests, or data releases should be directed to help@bmrb.io.\n   - For joint data set handling or any file conversion issues, contacting help@bmrb.io is advised.\n\nOverall, the document aims to assist depositors in preparing and validating structural data correctly, ensuring accurate annotations, and understanding software tools and validation processes used by wwPDB and BMRB.",

However, it has limitations in handling complex or very large structures, such as those with intricate beta sheet topologies or more than 99,999 ATOM lines.\n\nTo better accommodate these complexities, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) processes and archives macromolecular structure data mainly in the **PDBx/mmCIF format**, which can represent large and complex structures without loss of information.\n\nFor entries that cannot be fully represented in the legacy PDB format:\n\n- The entire structure is stored as a single mmCIF file.\n- A TAR archive containing minimal \"best effort\" files in the PDB format is also provided for compatibility with software relying on the older format.\n- The mmCIF flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` is set to \"N\" to indicate incompatibility with full legacy PDB formatting.\n\nSince June 2021, no standard PDB-format files are produced for entries with complex beta sheet topologies or exceeding 99,999 ATOM lines; all structural details are captured fully within mmCIF files.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The **PDB file format** is an older coordinate file format limited by size and complexity constraints.\n- The **mmCIF (PDBx/mmCIF) format** supersedes it for modern deposition and archiving due to its extensibility.\n- Minimal legacy-format files may still be provided alongside mmCIF for compatibility but flagged accordingly [ID:1][ID:3].\n\n### Key Points:\n- Legacy PDB format limited by maximum atom counts (~99,999 atoms) and complexity.\n- wwPDB uses primarily PDBx/mmCIF for deposition/archiving macromolecular structures.\n- Large/complex structures stored as single mmCIF files; minimal legacy-format files provided separately if needed.\n- Flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` indicates compatibility status (\"N\" means not compatible).\n- Since June 2021 no standard PDB-format files generated for very large or complex beta-sheet-containing entries [ID:1][ID:3].\n\n### References:\nAvailable reference IDs: [ID:1] [ID:3]\n```\n",

For these large or complex entries, single mmCIF files represent the entire structure, accompanied by TAR files containing minimal PDB-format files for compatibility with software reliant on the older format. In such cases, the mmCIF flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` is set to \"N\".\n\nHeader keywords (_struct_keywds.pdbx_keywords) assign a broad functional descriptor to each entry, chosen by annotators after reviewing UniProt and author-provided keywords. A standard list of headers, detailed in Appendix A and available online, guides these assignments. If the protein is an enzyme, the header reflects its enzyme class based on the E.C. number; unknown or putative functions use \"UNKNOWN FUNCTION\" or the putative class name. When multiple functions apply, headers are combined with a forward slash (e.g., TRANSCRIPTION/DNA), with \"complex\" noted in keywords but not in the header record itself.\n\nThe annotation process includes a detailed audit trail of revisions with categories such as structure model, database references, and source taxonomy, tracked down to minor and major revisions with dates. Related entries are linked via the pdbx_database_related category, indicating reuse or re-refinement of previous experimental data. For example, entry 1ZET is a re-refinement of data originally from 1T3N, with the re-refinement documented in REMARK 0 and associated citations maintained.\n\nLINK records describing covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide bonds (SSBOND) are generated automatically based on standard cutoff distances; authors may also add such records. The struct_conn category captures precise link details, including atom identifiers and distances. From June 2021, PDB-format files are no longer produced for entries with complex beta sheet topologies, but these are fully captured in mmCIF files.\n\nSecondary structure elements like helices and sheets are identified automatically by the Promotif algorithm and recorded in multiple categories (e.g., struct_conf, struct_sheet, pdbx_struct_sheet_hbond), though authors may supply their own annotations if desired.\n\nValidation includes bond length and angle deviation calculations using updated Engh & Huber parameters for proteins and Parkinson et al. statistics for nucleic acids, flagging deviations greater than six standard deviations. Backbone angles (PHI/PSI) are calculated per Kleywegt\u2019s methods. Validation results cover close contacts, symmetry-related contacts, bond lengths and angles, torsions, peptide bond conformations, planar groups, main chain planarity, and chirality, documented in specific mmCIF validation categories and REMARK 500.\n\nAdditional entry details, such as compound functional information (REMARK 400), polymer sequence details (REMARK 999), and ligand data (REMARK 600), are annotated under _pdbx_entry_details. Deprecated SITE records (_struct_site) are no longer used.\n\nThe wwPDB\u2019s processing procedures have evolved since 1999, with multiple updates to address new scientific methods, enhance annotation quality, and incorporate emerging standards such as reserved ligand IDs, chain ID policies for cleaved polymers, and biological assembly annotations. The current version (4.5, March 2025) documents all procedures, with versions and file format compliance clearly indicated in released files.\n\nIn summary, the wwPDB ensures high-quality, standardized macromolecular data deposition and annotation through rigorous header assignment, comprehensive audit tracking, detailed link and secondary structure annotation, thorough validation metrics, and careful legacy data integration, all centered on the robust and extensible mmCIF format.",

Authors review and approve curated entries before release; if no response is received within three weeks after validation, and no issues exist, entries are deemed approved. Entries are released once the associated publication is available. Authors may withdraw unreleased entries before publication, with withdrawn entries retained in the archive with status WDRN. Problematic entries (e.g., unusual chemistry, bond lengths, sequence mismatches) are discussed with authors; unresolved issues lead to withdrawal after a one-year hold unless a publication appears, in which case the entry is released with a caveat.\n\nCoordinate and experimental data files share the same release status and are released simultaneously. Entries are processed and released on a weekly schedule according to three statuses: REL (immediate release after approval), HPUB (held until publication or one year from deposition), or HOLD (held up to one year). Authors must submit release requests and corrections by Thursday noon local time; late requests are processed in the next cycle. Released data are packaged by RCSB-PDB and synchronized weekly among wwPDB FTP sites. On Saturdays, new entries\u2019 sequence, ligand InChI strings, and crystallization pH are posted online; updates occur Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC.\n\nUnreleased data are accessible only to authors; some metadata (title, authorship, sample sequences) may be publicly available with permission. Reviewers and journal referees do not have access to unreleased data but are encouraged to request wwPDB validation reports. If no author response occurs within three weeks and no issues exist, REL entries are released; entries with issues follow the Problem Structures policy. HPUB and HOLD entries can be held a maximum of one year from deposition; after ten months, wwPDB contacts authors regarding release or withdrawal decisions.\n\nPDB IDs and ligand codes are automatically assigned at deposition completion; they cannot be requested or reserved and may be changed by wwPDB. Before release, authors may update coordinates, experimental data, and header information anytime. Once marked for release, revisions can be submitted until the established deadline. After release, minor updates (e.g., citation, author name, or file format corrections) and major revisions (coordinate replacements, chemical composition changes, chain IDs, sequence modifications) are possible through depositor- or wwPDB-initiated updates, managed via the PDB archival versioning system.",

A list of classifications is available at the end of this document and at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/class.dat. Header functions are assigned by the annotator The annotator typically assigns the function after reviewing the UniProt keywords and keywords provided by the author. The annotated header will also be included in the entrykeywords (_struct_keywords.text)and if the header is a complex (/separated), the word\u2018complex\u2019will be added in the keywords. If protein is an enzyme, the general class of enzymes is used. For example, the header is assigned as oxidoreductase if the E.C. numberstarts with 1. See Appendix A or ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/class.dat for the list of available headers.If protein has no known function, \"UNKNOWN FUNCTION\"is used.If the function is putative, such as a \"putative hydrolase\"the header will be assigned based on the putative assignment, i.e., \"HYDROLASE\". If the annotator is unsure of the function, the annotator asks the author to choose theappropriate header from within the standard header list.If the function is new to the PDB, a generalized header describing the function will be added to the standard header list.Two or more HEADERs can be combined using the following rules:For macromolecular complexes, the headers are separated with a forward slash (HEADER1/HEADER2). e.g., TRANSCRIPTION/DNA (Note that protein is listed first in protein/nucleic acid complexes).The word \"complex\"will not be used in the header record but will appear in the ",

It covers diverse experimental methods\u2014X-ray crystallography, NMR, electron microscopy/electron crystallography (3DEM/EC), viral capsid assemblies, structural genomics\u2014and details data formatting, metadata, and validation requirements to ensure scientific reliability and usability.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Crystallographic Reflection Data:**  \n   Examples illustrate mmCIF formatting for reflection data across single and multiple refinement data sets, with precise unit cell parameters (e.g., a=118.86 \u00c5, b=155.03 \u00c5, space group C 2 2 21, wavelength 0.98100 \u00c5) and reflection counts (e.g., ~28,813 reflections from 1.769 to 19.546 \u00c5 resolution). Standards require proper annotation in mmCIF categories (_refln, _phasing_set_refln), preservation of author-supplied significant figures and hydrogen occupancies, automated calculation of Matthews coefficient and solvent content, and twinning annotations.\n\n2. **Structural Types and Assemblies:**  \n   - *Viral Capsids:* Defined via non-crystallographic symmetry with deposits including asymmetric unit coordinates plus 60 transformation matrices aligned to ViperDB reference frames.  \n   - *NMR Structures:* Pseudoatoms removed pre-deposition; a single domain superposition model is used; ensembles deposited alongside a minimized average (MODEL 1).  \n   - *3DEM/EC:* Deposits include atomic coordinates linked to EMDB 3D density maps in CCP4 format (converted from MRC if necessary), covering multiple methods and map subtypes (primary, half maps, masks, optional). Extensive metadata on data collection and reconstruction is required.  \n   - *Structural Genomics:* Entries from global SG centers follow standard processing with additional project-specific annotations and generally immediate data release.  \n   - *X-ray Crystallography:* Complete asymmetric unit atomic coordinates plus detailed crystallographic parameters are mandatory. Twinned and multi-dataset (e.g., MAD) data sets are supported with specific annotation protocols.\n\n3. **File Formats and Validation:**  \n   The mmCIF format accommodates large and complex structures beyond legacy PDB limitations. Deposits include TARred minimal PDB files flagged as partially incompatible for legacy support. Structural features such as covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide links are auto-generated and recorded. Secondary structures are identified automatically with author override options. Validation encompasses bond geometry, torsions, and other metrics, highlighting deviations beyond six standard deviations.\n\n4. **Annotation Guidelines:**  \n   Titles must clearly describe structures; author attribution and formatting follow literature conventions. Macromolecule naming aligns with UniProt unless modified; expression and source organism annotations use NCBI/UniProt taxonomy with synthetic and chimeric designations. Polymer sequences must be complete, including tags and modifications but excluding cleaved residues. Enzyme Commission numbers and mutations are precisely annotated. Biological assemblies include both author and software-derived data, with rigorous nomenclature for oligomeric states and thermodynamic data. Chain IDs allow up to four alphanumeric characters with sequence numbering aligning to UniProt where possible; missing residues and atoms are carefully flagged with REMARK records. Alternate conformations and chemically modified residues follow stringent annotation rules. Ligands are annotated with identifiers (InChI, SMILES), linked to the wwPDB Chemical Component Dictionary, and managed to avoid duplication with temporary IDs. Peptide-like inhibitors are carefully classified; chemical correctness and stereochemical ambiguity are clearly flagged. Unknown residues use defined placeholder codes with restrictions.\n\n5. **Versioning and History:**  \n   Entries employ major-minor version numbering to track coordinate and metadata changes, preserving all historical data to maintain integrity and reproducibility. Audit trails record revisions, re-refinements, and related deposits with citations.\n\n6. **Additional Notes:**  \n   Legacy site records (_struct_site, _struct_site_gen) ceased generation as of June 2021, though existing data remain. Synonymous ligand names and chemical modifications are managed to ensure clarity. The Biologically Interesting molecule Reference Dictionary (BIRD) standardizes annotation for peptide-like antibiotics and inhibitors and is regularly updated.\n\nOverall, these detailed standards and protocols enable consistent, validated, and comprehensive archiving of macromolecular structures, facilitating reliable data sharing, reproducibility, and reuse within the scientific community via the extensible mmCIF format.",

How are chain IDs related to residue numbering? All residues and chemical groups in a file should be uniquely identified. Once the polymers and chemical groups associated with them are assigned chain IDs, the numbering of all residues, chemical groups and waters for each chain ID must be unique. Numbering of residues that were not modelled due to limited experimental data should also be consideredhere. The wwPDB encourages deposition of polymer chains with sequential residuenumbering. For protein chains, the authors are encouraged to follow the UniProt residue numbering, wherever possible. The use of non-sequential residue numbering and insertion codes should be avoided as much as possible in order to make structures easily interpretableby the larger scientific community. If the coordinate residue numbers, as provided by the author, are unique and sequential within a particular chain ID, the residues will not be renumbered. If the author has already correctly sorted ligands to polymer chains with whichthey are associated, these are not reassigned. How polymer chain IDs should be assigned?Upper-and lower-case letters, numbers (0-9)and a combination of these should be used forchain IDs. It is preferred that lower case letters and combination of letters/numbers are used after all upper letters and numbers have been used. Symbols should never be used for chain IDs.Consistent use of chain IDs in PDB structures and manuscripts During the annotation of structures, the numbering and chain IDs of the chemical groups and waters associated with the polymeric chains may be changed in accordance with the wwPDB chain ID rules. The wwPDB strongly encourages depositors to use the wwPDB-assigned chain ID and residue numbers in any publication material. Deposition and processing of structures prior to preparation of the manuscript will ensure consistent usage of chain IDs and residue numbers in the manuscript and the PDB file. Validation and structure analysis reports generated during annotation may also be helpful in the manuscript preparation.

              "content": "The provided text contains guidance and information on processing structural biology data files, validation, and deposition protocols primarily related to X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction, and NMR structures, along with references to specific software tools and resources.\n\n1. **Data File Conversion and Processing:**\n   - For joint X-ray and neutron structure factor (SF) files, the recommended tool is \"pdb_extract\" from the RCSB website; within it, 'sf_convert' is used to convert MTZ files to mmCIF format. Example commands include specifying multiple data sets separated by colons, where the second data block corresponds to neutron data.\n   - Alternatively, the SF-tool (http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org) can be used for semi-automatic MTZ-to-mmCIF conversion, supporting multiple data sets.\n   - SF-tool can also generate map coefficients (phi and amplitude) needed for visualization in COOT if missing from original SF files. The process involves uploading files or entering a PDB code, selecting \u201cX-ray data using Refmac,\u201d running the job, downloading the MTZ, then loading it in COOT.\n\n2. **Validation Issues and Reporting:**\n   - Free R flags in deposited data are sometimes incorrect if calculated Free R is lower than reported values and resembles working set R values. In such cases, a corrected structure factor file with appropriate Free R flags should be provided.\n   - wwPDB validation treats chemically distinct alternate conformations occupying the same space as different residues with unique residue numbers; however, for microheterogeneity (e.g., partial cysteine modifications), the same residue number is maintained.\n   - MolProbity adds hydrogen atoms during validation for a complete model, which can generate apparent hydrogen clashes in reports. Users are advised to inspect these areas carefully.\n   - NMR validation reports can be improved by following best practices and resources given at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25330971/ and wwPDB NMR validation help pages.\n\n3. **Secondary Structure Annotation:**\n   - The pdb_extract program does not retain secondary structure elements after processing. If the default DSSP assignment is unsatisfactory, users can request to incorporate their secondary structure annotations via wwPDB communication channels.\n   - Secondary structure annotation used by wwPDB is via an in-house implementation of Promotif, integrated into Maxit software (available at https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html).\n\n4. **NMR Data Deposition Notes:**\n   - Only chemical-shift-based NMR data with proper restraints are accepted by wwPDB; entries generated solely from chemical shifts or restraints-only (e.g., from CS-ROSETTA, HADDOCK, NMR2) should be submitted to PDB-Dev.\n   - To combine multiple chemical shift files into one for OneDep, add specific header lines (e.g., save_assigned_chemical_shifts_1 and _2) to each file and concatenate them.\n   - \"AMBER auxiliary coordinate files\" are used to number atoms for NMR restraints differently than atom names; tutorials for creating these files are available on the Amber MD website.\n   - The system currently recognizes only CIF, PDB, and STAR file formats, but warnings for other file formats can be ignored if appropriate.\n   - For generating NMR-STAR 3.1 formatted chemical shift files, BMRB provides tools such as STARch (https://bmrb.io/software/starch/) and template generators (https://bmrb.io/software/tablege/). Users are encouraged to use direct exports from software like NMRView or CCPN when possible to maintain data integrity.\n\n5. **Contacts and Help:**\n   - Questions about BMRB entries, report requests, or data releases should be directed to help@bmrb.io.\n   - For joint data set handling or any file conversion issues, contacting help@bmrb.io is advised.\n\nOverall, the document aims to assist depositors in preparing and validating structural data correctly, ensuring accurate annotations, and understanding software tools and validation processes used by wwPDB and BMRB.",

It has limitations in handling complex structures, especially those with intricate beta sheet topologies or entries containing more than 99,999 ATOM lines.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) primarily processes and archives macromolecular structure data in the **PDBx/mmCIF format**, which better accommodates large and complex structures. For such entries:\n\n- The entire structure is represented as a single mmCIF file.\n- A TAR archive containing minimal \"best effort\" PDB-format files is provided for compatibility with software relying on the older format.\n- The mmCIF flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` is set to \"N\" indicating incompatibility with full legacy PDB formatting.\n\nSince June 2021, no standard PDB-format files are produced for entries with complex beta sheet topologies or exceeding 99,999 ATOM lines; all structural details are fully captured within mmCIF files.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The **PDB file format** is an older coordinate file format limited by size and complexity constraints.\n- The **mmCIF (PDBx/mmCIF) format** supersedes it for modern deposition and archiving needs due to its extensibility.\n- Minimal legacy-format files may still be provided alongside mmCIF for compatibility but flagged accordingly [ID:1][ID:3].\n\n### Key Points:\n- Legacy PDB format limited by maximum atom counts (~99,999 atoms) and complexity constraints.\n- wwPDB uses primarily PDBx/mmCIF for deposition/archiving macromolecular structures.\n- Large/complex structures stored as single mmCIF files; minimal legacy-format files provided separately if needed.\n- Flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` indicates compatibility status (\"N\" means not compatible).\n- Since June 2021 no standard PDB-format files generated for very large or complex beta-sheet-containing entries [ID:1][ID:3].\n\n### References:\n[ID:1] [ID:3]\n```",

To ensure that all wwPDB and related deposition tools function with minimal loss of data fidelity,depositors should output PDBx/mmCIF format files from their refinement program, if supported. A PDBx/mmCIF preparation guide is available. The format requirements for depositing structures are as follows: Coordinates and meta-data PDBx/mmCIF format: Deposition can be prepared in PDBx/mmCIF exchange format. Definitions and dictionary are available in HTML, ASCII, and XML format (see PDB format: Definitions and format content guide are available in PDF and HTMLformat (see http://wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format for details).Structure factorsThe structure factor file can either be in mmCIF or mtz formats and should include h,k, l, F, SigmaF (and/or I and SigmaI)and test flags.

For these large or complex entries, single mmCIF files represent the entire structure, accompanied by TAR files containing minimal PDB-format files for compatibility with software reliant on the older format. In such cases, the mmCIF flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` is set to \"N\".\n\nHeader keywords (_struct_keywds.pdbx_keywords) assign a broad functional descriptor to each entry, chosen by annotators after reviewing UniProt and author-provided keywords. A standard list of headers, detailed in Appendix A and available online, guides these assignments. If the protein is an enzyme, the header reflects its enzyme class based on the E.C. number; unknown or putative functions use \"UNKNOWN FUNCTION\" or the putative class name. When multiple functions apply, headers are combined with a forward slash (e.g., TRANSCRIPTION/DNA), with \"complex\" noted in keywords but not in the header record itself.\n\nThe annotation process includes a detailed audit trail of revisions with categories such as structure model, database references, and source taxonomy, tracked down to minor and major revisions with dates. Related entries are linked via the pdbx_database_related category, indicating reuse or re-refinement of previous experimental data. For example, entry 1ZET is a re-refinement of data originally from 1T3N, with the re-refinement documented in REMARK 0 and associated citations maintained.\n\nLINK records describing covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide bonds (SSBOND) are generated automatically based on standard cutoff distances; authors may also add such records. The struct_conn category captures precise link details, including atom identifiers and distances. From June 2021, PDB-format files are no longer produced for entries with complex beta sheet topologies, but these are fully captured in mmCIF files.\n\nSecondary structure elements like helices and sheets are identified automatically by the Promotif algorithm and recorded in multiple categories (e.g., struct_conf, struct_sheet, pdbx_struct_sheet_hbond), though authors may supply their own annotations if desired.\n\nValidation includes bond length and angle deviation calculations using updated Engh & Huber parameters for proteins and Parkinson et al. statistics for nucleic acids, flagging deviations greater than six standard deviations. Backbone angles (PHI/PSI) are calculated per Kleywegt\u2019s methods. Validation results cover close contacts, symmetry-related contacts, bond lengths and angles, torsions, peptide bond conformations, planar groups, main chain planarity, and chirality, documented in specific mmCIF validation categories and REMARK 500.\n\nAdditional entry details, such as compound functional information (REMARK 400), polymer sequence details (REMARK 999), and ligand data (REMARK 600), are annotated under _pdbx_entry_details. Deprecated SITE records (_struct_site) are no longer used.\n\nThe wwPDB\u2019s processing procedures have evolved since 1999, with multiple updates to address new scientific methods, enhance annotation quality, and incorporate emerging standards such as reserved ligand IDs, chain ID policies for cleaved polymers, and biological assembly annotations. The current version (4.5, March 2025) documents all procedures, with versions and file format compliance clearly indicated in released files.\n\nIn summary, the wwPDB ensures high-quality, standardized macromolecular data deposition and annotation through rigorous header assignment, comprehensive audit tracking, detailed link and secondary structure annotation, thorough validation metrics, and careful legacy data integration, all centered on the robust and extensible mmCIF format.",

Authors review and approve curated entries before release; if no response is received within three weeks after validation, and no issues exist, entries are deemed approved. Entries are released once the associated publication is available. Authors may withdraw unreleased entries before publication, with withdrawn entries retained in the archive with status WDRN. Problematic entries (e.g., unusual chemistry, bond lengths, sequence mismatches) are discussed with authors; unresolved issues lead to withdrawal after a one-year hold unless a publication appears, in which case the entry is released with a caveat.\n\nCoordinate and experimental data files share the same release status and are released simultaneously. Entries are processed and released on a weekly schedule according to three statuses: REL (immediate release after approval), HPUB (held until publication or one year from deposition), or HOLD (held up to one year). Authors must submit release requests and corrections by Thursday noon local time; late requests are processed in the next cycle. Released data are packaged by RCSB-PDB and synchronized weekly among wwPDB FTP sites. On Saturdays, new entries\u2019 sequence, ligand InChI strings, and crystallization pH are posted online; updates occur Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC.\n\nUnreleased data are accessible only to authors; some metadata (title, authorship, sample sequences) may be publicly available with permission. Reviewers and journal referees do not have access to unreleased data but are encouraged to request wwPDB validation reports. If no author response occurs within three weeks and no issues exist, REL entries are released; entries with issues follow the Problem Structures policy. HPUB and HOLD entries can be held a maximum of one year from deposition; after ten months, wwPDB contacts authors regarding release or withdrawal decisions.\n\nPDB IDs and ligand codes are automatically assigned at deposition completion; they cannot be requested or reserved and may be changed by wwPDB. Before release, authors may update coordinates, experimental data, and header information anytime. Once marked for release, revisions can be submitted until the established deadline. After release, minor updates (e.g., citation, author name, or file format corrections) and major revisions (coordinate replacements, chemical composition changes, chain IDs, sequence modifications) are possible through depositor- or wwPDB-initiated updates, managed via the PDB archival versioning system.",

HEADER assignment How is the header keyword (_struct_keywds.pdbx_keywords)record assigned? One keyword is used to briefly describe the broad function of the macromolecules present inthe PDB entry. A list of classifications is available at the end of this document and at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/class.dat. Header functions are assigned by the annotator The annotator typically assigns the function after reviewing the UniProt keywords and keywords provided by the author. The annotated header will also be included in the entrykeywords (_struct_keywords.text)and if the header is a complex (/separated), the word\u2018complex\u2019will be added in the keywords. If protein is an enzyme, the general class of enzymes is used. For example, the header is assigned as oxidoreductase if the E.C. numberstarts with 1. See Appendix A or ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/class.dat for the list of available headers.If protein has no known function, \"UNKNOWN FUNCTION\"is used.If the function is putative, such as a \"putative hydrolase\"the header will be assigned based on the putative assignment, i.e., \"HYDROLASE\". If the annotator is unsure of the function, the annotator asks the author to choose theappropriate header from within the standard header list.If the function is new to the PDB, a generalized header describing the function will be added to the standard header list.Two or more HEADERs can be combined using the following rules:For macromolecular complexes, the headers are separated with a forward slash (HEADER1/HEADER2). e.g., TRANSCRIPTION/DNA (Note that protein is listed first in protein/nucleic acid complexes).The word \"complex\"will not be used in the header record but will appear in the ",

It covers diverse experimental methods\u2014X-ray crystallography, NMR, electron microscopy/electron crystallography (3DEM/EC), viral capsid assemblies, structural genomics\u2014and details data formatting, metadata, and validation requirements to ensure scientific reliability and usability.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Crystallographic Reflection Data:**  \n   Examples illustrate mmCIF formatting for reflection data across single and multiple refinement data sets, with precise unit cell parameters (e.g., a=118.86 \u00c5, b=155.03 \u00c5, space group C 2 2 21, wavelength 0.98100 \u00c5) and reflection counts (e.g., ~28,813 reflections from 1.769 to 19.546 \u00c5 resolution). Standards require proper annotation in mmCIF categories (_refln, _phasing_set_refln), preservation of author-supplied significant figures and hydrogen occupancies, automated calculation of Matthews coefficient and solvent content, and twinning annotations.\n\n2. **Structural Types and Assemblies:**  \n   - *Viral Capsids:* Defined via non-crystallographic symmetry with deposits including asymmetric unit coordinates plus 60 transformation matrices aligned to ViperDB reference frames.  \n   - *NMR Structures:* Pseudoatoms removed pre-deposition; a single domain superposition model is used; ensembles deposited alongside a minimized average (MODEL 1).  \n   - *3DEM/EC:* Deposits include atomic coordinates linked to EMDB 3D density maps in CCP4 format (converted from MRC if necessary), covering multiple methods and map subtypes (primary, half maps, masks, optional). Extensive metadata on data collection and reconstruction is required.  \n   - *Structural Genomics:* Entries from global SG centers follow standard processing with additional project-specific annotations and generally immediate data release.  \n   - *X-ray Crystallography:* Complete asymmetric unit atomic coordinates plus detailed crystallographic parameters are mandatory. Twinned and multi-dataset (e.g., MAD) data sets are supported with specific annotation protocols.\n\n3. **File Formats and Validation:**  \n   The mmCIF format accommodates large and complex structures beyond legacy PDB limitations. Deposits include TARred minimal PDB files flagged as partially incompatible for legacy support. Structural features such as covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide links are auto-generated and recorded. Secondary structures are identified automatically with author override options. Validation encompasses bond geometry, torsions, and other metrics, highlighting deviations beyond six standard deviations.\n\n4. **Annotation Guidelines:**  \n   Titles must clearly describe structures; author attribution and formatting follow literature conventions. Macromolecule naming aligns with UniProt unless modified; expression and source organism annotations use NCBI/UniProt taxonomy with synthetic and chimeric designations. Polymer sequences must be complete, including tags and modifications but excluding cleaved residues. Enzyme Commission numbers and mutations are precisely annotated. Biological assemblies include both author and software-derived data, with rigorous nomenclature for oligomeric states and thermodynamic data. Chain IDs allow up to four alphanumeric characters with sequence numbering aligning to UniProt where possible; missing residues and atoms are carefully flagged with REMARK records. Alternate conformations and chemically modified residues follow stringent annotation rules. Ligands are annotated with identifiers (InChI, SMILES), linked to the wwPDB Chemical Component Dictionary, and managed to avoid duplication with temporary IDs. Peptide-like inhibitors are carefully classified; chemical correctness and stereochemical ambiguity are clearly flagged. Unknown residues use defined placeholder codes with restrictions.\n\n5. **Versioning and History:**  \n   Entries employ major-minor version numbering to track coordinate and metadata changes, preserving all historical data to maintain integrity and reproducibility. Audit trails record revisions, re-refinements, and related deposits with citations.\n\n6. **Additional Notes:**  \n   Legacy site records (_struct_site, _struct_site_gen) ceased generation as of June 2021, though existing data remain. Synonymous ligand names and chemical modifications are managed to ensure clarity. The Biologically Interesting molecule Reference Dictionary (BIRD) standardizes annotation for peptide-like antibiotics and inhibitors and is regularly updated.\n\nOverall, these detailed standards and protocols enable consistent, validated, and comprehensive archiving of macromolecular structures, facilitating reliable data sharing, reproducibility, and reuse within the scientific community via the extensible mmCIF format.",

How are chain IDs related to residue numbering? All residues and chemical groups in a file should be uniquely identified. Once the polymers and chemical groups associated with them are assigned chain IDs, the numbering of all residues, chemical groups and waters for each chain ID must be unique. Numbering of residues that were not modelled due to limited experimental data should also be consideredhere. The wwPDB encourages deposition of polymer chains with sequential residuenumbering. For protein chains, the authors are encouraged to follow the UniProt residue numbering, wherever possible. The use of non-sequential residue numbering and insertion codes should be avoided as much as possible in order to make structures easily interpretableby the larger scientific community. If the coordinate residue numbers, as provided by the author, are unique and sequential within a particular chain ID, the residues will not be renumbered. If the author has already correctly sorted ligands to polymer chains with whichthey are associated, these are not reassigned. How polymer chain IDs should be assigned?Upper-and lower-case letters, numbers (0-9)and a combination of these should be used forchain IDs. It is preferred that lower case letters and combination of letters/numbers are used after all upper letters and numbers have been used. Symbols should never be used for chain IDs.Consistent use of chain IDs in PDB structures and manuscripts During the annotation of structures, the numbering and chain IDs of the chemical groups and waters associated with the polymeric chains may be changed in accordance with the wwPDB chain ID rules. The wwPDB strongly encourages depositors to use the wwPDB-assigned chain ID and residue numbers in any publication material. Deposition and processing of structures prior to preparation of the manuscript will ensure consistent usage of chain IDs and residue numbers in the manuscript and the PDB file. Validation and structure analysis reports generated during annotation may also be helpful in the manuscript preparation.

Example commands include specifying multiple data sets separated by colons, where the second data block corresponds to neutron data.\n   - Alternatively, the SF-tool (http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org) can be used for semi-automatic MTZ-to-mmCIF conversion, supporting multiple data sets.\n   - SF-tool can also generate map coefficients (phi and amplitude) needed for visualization in COOT if missing from original SF files. The process involves uploading files or entering a PDB code, selecting \u201cX-ray data using Refmac,\u201d running the job, downloading the MTZ, then loading it in COOT.\n\n2. **Validation Issues and Reporting:**\n   - Free R flags in deposited data are sometimes incorrect if calculated Free R is lower than reported values and resembles working set R values. In such cases, a corrected structure factor file with appropriate Free R flags should be provided.\n   - wwPDB validation treats chemically distinct alternate conformations occupying the same space as different residues with unique residue numbers; however, for microheterogeneity (e.g., partial cysteine modifications), the same residue number is maintained.\n   - MolProbity adds hydrogen atoms during validation for a complete model, which can generate apparent hydrogen clashes in reports. Users are advised to inspect these areas carefully.\n   - NMR validation reports can be improved by following best practices and resources given at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25330971/ and wwPDB NMR validation help pages.\n\n3. **Secondary Structure Annotation:**\n   - The pdb_extract program does not retain secondary structure elements after processing. If the default DSSP assignment is unsatisfactory, users can request to incorporate their secondary structure annotations via wwPDB communication channels.\n   - Secondary structure annotation used by wwPDB is via an in-house implementation of Promotif, integrated into Maxit software (available at https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html).\n\n4. **NMR Data Deposition Notes:**\n   - Only chemical-shift-based NMR data with proper restraints are accepted by wwPDB; entries generated solely from chemical shifts or restraints-only (e.g., from CS-ROSETTA, HADDOCK, NMR2) should be submitted to PDB-Dev.\n   - To combine multiple chemical shift files into one for OneDep, add specific header lines (e.g., save_assigned_chemical_shifts_1 and _2) to each file and concatenate them.\n   - \"AMBER auxiliary coordinate files\" are used to number atoms for NMR restraints differently than atom names; tutorials for creating these files are available on the Amber MD website.\n   - The system currently recognizes only CIF, PDB, and STAR file formats, but warnings for other file formats can be ignored if appropriate.\n   - For generating NMR-STAR 3.1 formatted chemical shift files, BMRB provides tools such as STARch (https://bmrb.io/software/starch/) and template generators (https://bmrb.io/software/tablege/). Users are encouraged to use direct exports from software like NMRView or CCPN when possible to maintain data integrity.\n\n5. **Contacts and Help:**\n   - Questions about BMRB entries, report requests, or data releases should be directed to help@bmrb.io.\n   - For joint data set handling or any file conversion issues, contacting help@bmrb.io is advised.\n\nOverall, the document aims to assist depositors in preparing and validating structural data correctly, ensuring accurate annotations, and understanding software tools and validation processes used by wwPDB and BMRB.",

It has limitations in handling complex or very large structures, such as those with intricate beta sheet topologies or more than 99,999 ATOM lines.\n\nTo better accommodate these complexities, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) processes and archives macromolecular structure data mainly in the **PDBx/mmCIF format**, which can represent large and complex structures without loss of information.\n\nFor entries that cannot be fully represented in the legacy PDB format:\n\n- The entire structure is stored as a single mmCIF file.\n- A TAR archive containing minimal \"best effort\" files in the PDB format is also provided for compatibility with software relying on the older format.\n- The mmCIF flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` is set to \"N\" to indicate incompatibility with full legacy PDB formatting.\n\nSince June 2021, no standard PDB-format files are produced for entries with complex beta sheet topologies or exceeding 99,999 ATOM lines; all structural details are captured fully within mmCIF files.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The **PDB file format** is an older coordinate file format limited by size and complexity constraints.\n- The **mmCIF (PDBx/mmCIF) format** supersedes it for modern deposition and archiving due to its extensibility.\n- Minimal legacy-format files may still be provided alongside mmCIF for compatibility but flagged accordingly [ID:1][ID:3].\n\n### References:\n[ID:1] [ID:3]\n```",

To ensure that all wwPDB and related deposition tools function with minimal loss of data fidelity,depositors should output PDBx/mmCIF format files from their refinement program, if supported. A PDBx/mmCIF preparation guide is available. The format requirements for depositing structures are as follows: Coordinates and meta-data PDBx/mmCIF format: Deposition can be prepared in PDBx/mmCIF exchange format. Definitions and dictionary are available in HTML, ASCII, and XML format (see PDB format: Definitions and format content guide are available in PDF and HTMLformat (see http://wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format for details).Structure factorsThe structure factor file can either be in mmCIF or mtz formats and should include h,k, l, F, SigmaF (and/or I and SigmaI)and test flags.

              "content": "The wwPDB processes and archives macromolecular structure data primarily in the PDBx/mmCIF format to better handle complex structures, such as those with intricate beta sheet topologies or over 99,999 ATOM lines, which cannot be accurately represented in the legacy PDB format. For these large or complex entries, single mmCIF files represent the entire structure, accompanied by TAR files containing minimal PDB-format files for compatibility with software reliant on the older format. In such cases, the mmCIF flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` is set to \"N\".\n\nHeader keywords (_struct_keywds.pdbx_keywords) assign a broad functional descriptor to each entry, chosen by annotators after reviewing UniProt and author-provided keywords. A standard list of headers, detailed in Appendix A and available online, guides these assignments. If the protein is an enzyme, the header reflects its enzyme class based on the E.C. number; unknown or putative functions use \"UNKNOWN FUNCTION\" or the putative class name. When multiple functions apply, headers are combined with a forward slash (e.g., TRANSCRIPTION/DNA), with \"complex\" noted in keywords but not in the header record itself.\n\nThe annotation process includes a detailed audit trail of revisions with categories such as structure model, database references, and source taxonomy, tracked down to minor and major revisions with dates. Related entries are linked via the pdbx_database_related category, indicating reuse or re-refinement of previous experimental data. For example, entry 1ZET is a re-refinement of data originally from 1T3N, with the re-refinement documented in REMARK 0 and associated citations maintained.\n\nLINK records describing covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide bonds (SSBOND) are generated automatically based on standard cutoff distances; authors may also add such records. The struct_conn category captures precise link details, including atom identifiers and distances. From June 2021, PDB-format files are no longer produced for entries with complex beta sheet topologies, but these are fully captured in mmCIF files.\n\nSecondary structure elements like helices and sheets are identified automatically by the Promotif algorithm and recorded in multiple categories (e.g., struct_conf, struct_sheet, pdbx_struct_sheet_hbond), though authors may supply their own annotations if desired.\n\nValidation includes bond length and angle deviation calculations using updated Engh & Huber parameters for proteins and Parkinson et al. statistics for nucleic acids, flagging deviations greater than six standard deviations. Backbone angles (PHI/PSI) are calculated per Kleywegt\u2019s methods. Validation results cover close contacts, symmetry-related contacts, bond lengths and angles, torsions, peptide bond conformations, planar groups, main chain planarity, and chirality, documented in specific mmCIF validation categories and REMARK 500.\n\nAdditional entry details, such as compound functional information (REMARK 400), polymer sequence details (REMARK 999), and ligand data (REMARK 600), are annotated under _pdbx_entry_details. Deprecated SITE records (_struct_site) are no longer used.\n\nThe wwPDB\u2019s processing procedures have evolved since 1999, with multiple updates to address new scientific methods, enhance annotation quality, and incorporate emerging standards such as reserved ligand IDs, chain ID policies for cleaved polymers, and biological assembly annotations. The current version (4.5, March 2025) documents all procedures, with versions and file format compliance clearly indicated in released files.\n\nIn summary, the wwPDB ensures high-quality, standardized macromolecular data deposition and annotation through rigorous header assignment, comprehensive audit tracking, detailed link and secondary structure annotation, thorough validation metrics, and careful legacy data integration, all centered on the robust and extensible mmCIF format.",

Authors review and approve curated entries before release; if no response is received within three weeks after validation, and no issues exist, entries are deemed approved. Entries are released once the associated publication is available. Authors may withdraw unreleased entries before publication, with withdrawn entries retained in the archive with status WDRN. Problematic entries (e.g., unusual chemistry, bond lengths, sequence mismatches) are discussed with authors; unresolved issues lead to withdrawal after a one-year hold unless a publication appears, in which case the entry is released with a caveat.\n\nCoordinate and experimental data files share the same release status and are released simultaneously. Entries are processed and released on a weekly schedule according to three statuses: REL (immediate release after approval), HPUB (held until publication or one year from deposition), or HOLD (held up to one year). Authors must submit release requests and corrections by Thursday noon local time; late requests are processed in the next cycle. Released data are packaged by RCSB-PDB and synchronized weekly among wwPDB FTP sites. On Saturdays, new entries\u2019 sequence, ligand InChI strings, and crystallization pH are posted online; updates occur Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC.\n\nUnreleased data are accessible only to authors; some metadata (title, authorship, sample sequences) may be publicly available with permission. Reviewers and journal referees do not have access to unreleased data but are encouraged to request wwPDB validation reports. If no author response occurs within three weeks and no issues exist, REL entries are released; entries with issues follow the Problem Structures policy. HPUB and HOLD entries can be held a maximum of one year from deposition; after ten months, wwPDB contacts authors regarding release or withdrawal decisions.\n\nPDB IDs and ligand codes are automatically assigned at deposition completion; they cannot be requested or reserved and may be changed by wwPDB. Before release, authors may update coordinates, experimental data, and header information anytime. Once marked for release, revisions can be submitted until the established deadline. After release, minor updates (e.g., citation, author name, or file format corrections) and major revisions (coordinate replacements, chemical composition changes, chain IDs, sequence modifications) are possible through depositor- or wwPDB-initiated updates, managed via the PDB archival versioning system.",

A list of classifications is available at the end of this document and at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/class.dat. Header functions are assigned by the annotator The annotator typically assigns the function after reviewing the UniProt keywords and keywords provided by the author. The annotated header will also be included in the entrykeywords (_struct_keywords.text)and if the header is a complex (/separated), the word\u2018complex\u2019will be added in the keywords. If protein is an enzyme, the general class of enzymes is used. For example, the header is assigned as oxidoreductase if the E.C. numberstarts with 1. See Appendix A or ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/class.dat for the list of available headers.If protein has no known function, \"UNKNOWN FUNCTION\"is used.If the function is putative, such as a \"putative hydrolase\"the header will be assigned based on the putative assignment, i.e., \"HYDROLASE\". If the annotator is unsure of the function, the annotator asks the author to choose theappropriate header from within the standard header list.If the function is new to the PDB, a generalized header describing the function will be added to the standard header list.Two or more HEADERs can be combined using the following rules:For macromolecular complexes, the headers are separated with a forward slash (HEADER1/HEADER2). e.g., TRANSCRIPTION/DNA (Note that protein is listed first in protein/nucleic acid complexes).The word \"complex\"will not be used in the header record but will appear in the ",

It covers diverse experimental methods\u2014X-ray crystallography, NMR, electron microscopy/electron crystallography (3DEM/EC), viral capsid assemblies, structural genomics\u2014and details data formatting, metadata, and validation requirements to ensure scientific reliability and usability.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Crystallographic Reflection Data:**  \n   Examples illustrate mmCIF formatting for reflection data across single and multiple refinement data sets, with precise unit cell parameters (e.g., a=118.86 \u00c5, b=155.03 \u00c5, space group C 2 2 21, wavelength 0.98100 \u00c5) and reflection counts (e.g., ~28,813 reflections from 1.769 to 19.546 \u00c5 resolution). Standards require proper annotation in mmCIF categories (_refln, _phasing_set_refln), preservation of author-supplied significant figures and hydrogen occupancies, automated calculation of Matthews coefficient and solvent content, and twinning annotations.\n\n2. **Structural Types and Assemblies:**  \n   - *Viral Capsids:* Defined via non-crystallographic symmetry with deposits including asymmetric unit coordinates plus 60 transformation matrices aligned to ViperDB reference frames.  \n   - *NMR Structures:* Pseudoatoms removed pre-deposition; a single domain superposition model is used; ensembles deposited alongside a minimized average (MODEL 1).  \n   - *3DEM/EC:* Deposits include atomic coordinates linked to EMDB 3D density maps in CCP4 format (converted from MRC if necessary), covering multiple methods and map subtypes (primary, half maps, masks, optional). Extensive metadata on data collection and reconstruction is required.  \n   - *Structural Genomics:* Entries from global SG centers follow standard processing with additional project-specific annotations and generally immediate data release.  \n   - *X-ray Crystallography:* Complete asymmetric unit atomic coordinates plus detailed crystallographic parameters are mandatory. Twinned and multi-dataset (e.g., MAD) data sets are supported with specific annotation protocols.\n\n3. **File Formats and Validation:**  \n   The mmCIF format accommodates large and complex structures beyond legacy PDB limitations. Deposits include TARred minimal PDB files flagged as partially incompatible for legacy support. Structural features such as covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide links are auto-generated and recorded. Secondary structures are identified automatically with author override options. Validation encompasses bond geometry, torsions, and other metrics, highlighting deviations beyond six standard deviations.\n\n4. **Annotation Guidelines:**  \n   Titles must clearly describe structures; author attribution and formatting follow literature conventions. Macromolecule naming aligns with UniProt unless modified; expression and source organism annotations use NCBI/UniProt taxonomy with synthetic and chimeric designations. Polymer sequences must be complete, including tags and modifications but excluding cleaved residues. Enzyme Commission numbers and mutations are precisely annotated. Biological assemblies include both author and software-derived data, with rigorous nomenclature for oligomeric states and thermodynamic data. Chain IDs allow up to four alphanumeric characters with sequence numbering aligning to UniProt where possible; missing residues and atoms are carefully flagged with REMARK records. Alternate conformations and chemically modified residues follow stringent annotation rules. Ligands are annotated with identifiers (InChI, SMILES), linked to the wwPDB Chemical Component Dictionary, and managed to avoid duplication with temporary IDs. Peptide-like inhibitors are carefully classified; chemical correctness and stereochemical ambiguity are clearly flagged. Unknown residues use defined placeholder codes with restrictions.\n\n5. **Versioning and History:**  \n   Entries employ major-minor version numbering to track coordinate and metadata changes, preserving all historical data to maintain integrity and reproducibility. Audit trails record revisions, re-refinements, and related deposits with citations.\n\n6. **Additional Notes:**  \n   Legacy site records (_struct_site, _struct_site_gen) ceased generation as of June 2021, though existing data remain. Synonymous ligand names and chemical modifications are managed to ensure clarity. The Biologically Interesting molecule Reference Dictionary (BIRD) standardizes annotation for peptide-like antibiotics and inhibitors and is regularly updated.\n\nOverall, these detailed standards and protocols enable consistent, validated, and comprehensive archiving of macromolecular structures, facilitating reliable data sharing, reproducibility, and reuse within the scientific community via the extensible mmCIF format.",

How are chain IDs related to residue numbering? All residues and chemical groups in a file should be uniquely identified. Once the polymers and chemical groups associated with them are assigned chain IDs, the numbering of all residues, chemical groups and waters for each chain ID must be unique. Numbering of residues that were not modelled due to limited experimental data should also be consideredhere. The wwPDB encourages deposition of polymer chains with sequential residuenumbering. For protein chains, the authors are encouraged to follow the UniProt residue numbering, wherever possible. The use of non-sequential residue numbering and insertion codes should be avoided as much as possible in order to make structures easily interpretableby the larger scientific community. If the coordinate residue numbers, as provided by the author, are unique and sequential within a particular chain ID, the residues will not be renumbered. If the author has already correctly sorted ligands to polymer chains with whichthey are associated, these are not reassigned. How polymer chain IDs should be assigned?Upper-and lower-case letters, numbers (0-9)and a combination of these should be used forchain IDs. It is preferred that lower case letters and combination of letters/numbers are used after all upper letters and numbers have been used. Symbols should never be used for chain IDs.Consistent use of chain IDs in PDB structures and manuscripts During the annotation of structures, the numbering and chain IDs of the chemical groups and waters associated with the polymeric chains may be changed in accordance with the wwPDB chain ID rules. The wwPDB strongly encourages depositors to use the wwPDB-assigned chain ID and residue numbers in any publication material. Deposition and processing of structures prior to preparation of the manuscript will ensure consistent usage of chain IDs and residue numbers in the manuscript and the PDB file. Validation and structure analysis reports generated during annotation may also be helpful in the manuscript preparation.

              "content": "The provided text contains guidance and information on processing structural biology data files, validation, and deposition protocols primarily related to X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction, and NMR structures, along with references to specific software tools and resources.\n\n1. **Data File Conversion and Processing:**\n   - For joint X-ray and neutron structure factor (SF) files, the recommended tool is \"pdb_extract\" from the RCSB website; within it, 'sf_convert' is used to convert MTZ files to mmCIF format. Example commands include specifying multiple data sets separated by colons, where the second data block corresponds to neutron data.\n   - Alternatively, the SF-tool (http://sf-tool.wwpdb.org) can be used for semi-automatic MTZ-to-mmCIF conversion, supporting multiple data sets.\n   - SF-tool can also generate map coefficients (phi and amplitude) needed for visualization in COOT if missing from original SF files. The process involves uploading files or entering a PDB code, selecting \u201cX-ray data using Refmac,\u201d running the job, downloading the MTZ, then loading it in COOT.\n\n2. **Validation Issues and Reporting:**\n   - Free R flags in deposited data are sometimes incorrect if calculated Free R is lower than reported values and resembles working set R values. In such cases, a corrected structure factor file with appropriate Free R flags should be provided.\n   - wwPDB validation treats chemically distinct alternate conformations occupying the same space as different residues with unique residue numbers; however, for microheterogeneity (e.g., partial cysteine modifications), the same residue number is maintained.\n   - MolProbity adds hydrogen atoms during validation for a complete model, which can generate apparent hydrogen clashes in reports. Users are advised to inspect these areas carefully.\n   - NMR validation reports can be improved by following best practices and resources given at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25330971/ and wwPDB NMR validation help pages.\n\n3. **Secondary Structure Annotation:**\n   - The pdb_extract program does not retain secondary structure elements after processing. If the default DSSP assignment is unsatisfactory, users can request to incorporate their secondary structure annotations via wwPDB communication channels.\n   - Secondary structure annotation used by wwPDB is via an in-house implementation of Promotif, integrated into Maxit software (available at https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/source.html).\n\n4. **NMR Data Deposition Notes:**\n   - Only chemical-shift-based NMR data with proper restraints are accepted by wwPDB; entries generated solely from chemical shifts or restraints-only (e.g., from CS-ROSETTA, HADDOCK, NMR2) should be submitted to PDB-Dev.\n   - To combine multiple chemical shift files into one for OneDep, add specific header lines (e.g., save_assigned_chemical_shifts_1 and _2) to each file and concatenate them.\n   - \"AMBER auxiliary coordinate files\" are used to number atoms for NMR restraints differently than atom names; tutorials for creating these files are available on the Amber MD website.\n   - The system currently recognizes only CIF, PDB, and STAR file formats, but warnings for other file formats can be ignored if appropriate.\n   - For generating NMR-STAR 3.1 formatted chemical shift files, BMRB provides tools such as STARch (https://bmrb.io/software/starch/) and template generators (https://bmrb.io/software/tablege/). Users are encouraged to use direct exports from software like NMRView or CCPN when possible to maintain data integrity.\n\n5. **Contacts and Help:**\n   - Questions about BMRB entries, report requests, or data releases should be directed to help@bmrb.io.\n   - For joint data set handling or any file conversion issues, contacting help@bmrb.io is advised.\n\nOverall, the document aims to assist depositors in preparing and validating structural data correctly, ensuring accurate annotations, and understanding software tools and validation processes used by wwPDB and BMRB.",

              "content": "The provided text contains multiple Q&A style guidance and policies related to structure deposition and management in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and related archives:\n\n1. **Theoretical vs Experimental Models**: PDB primarily accepts structures derived from experimental data (X-ray, NMR, EM). Theoretical or computational models should be deposited in the Model Archive (https://www.modelarchive.org). Integrative or hybrid models based on other biophysical data can be deposited at pdb-dev (https://pdb-dev.wwpdb.org/about/).\n\n2. **Replacing Coordinates for Released Entries**: \n   - Option 1: Submit a new deposition with a new PDB ID which will obsolete the old entry; mandatory if structure factors are changed.\n   - Option 2: Upload corrected coordinates for released entries deposited via OneDep, with restrictions: only coordinate and metadata changes allowed (no structure factors); only one correction per year per entry; each Principal Investigator (PI) can correct up to three entries per year this way.\n\n3. **Refinement Software and Data Challenges**: Differences in refinement software versions (e.g., REFMAC changes in CCP4 7.0) and incomplete recording of all refinement parameters lead to challenges in reproducing depositor refinement results. Complex structure factor files and use of special parameters like wavelength data can add difficulty.\n\n4. **Metadata Changes Post-Annotation**: Some metadata (e.g., macromolecule name, source, expression system) tightly linked to the annotation process cannot be altered by depositors directly after annotation. Requests should be made via the communication tab within the deposition interface.\n\n5. **Entry Release and Publication Matching**: \n   - PDB tries to automatically match deposition citations to publications, but low similarity between tentative and final citation titles can prevent automatic recognition.\n   - Authors, journals, and users are encouraged to notify PDB of the publication of primary citations referencing PDB entries.\n\n6. **Re-uploading Coordinates with Different Chain IDs or Numbers**: Changing polymer chain IDs or the number of chains requires resetting the deposition interface. After an initial failed upload attempt, a second upload with deselected old files triggers a reset option to incorporate new coordinates.\n\n7. **Depositing Multiple Structures**: \n   - Use pdb_extract (http://pdb-extract.wwpdb.org) to prepare files efficiently.\n   - Upload coordinate and structure factor files from the final refinement round; adding LOG/output files allows automatic parsing of collection statistics and refinement data.\n   - Deposit the first of multiple related entries with complete information, then use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option to import metadata into subsequent depositions, minimizing manual input.\n   - Multiple depositions can be started independently but only one session can be active per user at a time.\n\n8. **Generating PDB Accession-Ready Files**: \n   - Recent versions of refinement software (Pheix, REFMAC, Buster) generate PDBx/mmCIF files suitable for direct deposition.\n   - Instructions and tools are available at software-specific sites and wwPDB\u2019s preparation pages (https://www.wwpdb.org/deposition/preparing-pdbx-mmcif-files).\n   - For other software users, wwPDB provides standalone and web-based tools like pdb_extract to convert legacy PDB format files to PDBx/mmCIF.\n\n9. **Communication and Submission Interface Usage**: Depositors are encouraged to use the deposition interface communication tab for requests and queries to ensure proper tracking and handling.\n\n10. **Additional Topics Mentioned** (not elaborated in the text): Guidance on experimental methods (EM, NMR), handling validation reports, deposition of composite and half maps, handling large numbers of depositions (group depositions), dealing with chemical shift files for NMR, and other technical and policy-related matters.\n\nOverall, the text serves as a comprehensive FAQ and policy overview addressing common depositor questions on submission processes, structure types accepted, correction procedures, metadata edits, file preparation, and related administrative aspects within the PDB deposition ecosystem.",

              "content": "The wwPDB archives macromolecular structures primarily using the PDBx/mmCIF format, enabling representation of large and complex structures beyond the limitations of the legacy PDB format. For such entries, a single comprehensive mmCIF file is provided alongside TAR archives of minimal PDB-format files for compatibility; these entries have the mmCIF flag `_pdbx_database_status.pdb_format_compatible` set to \"N\". Functional descriptors for entries are assigned via standardized header keywords based on UniProt and author data, incorporating enzyme classifications or marking unknown functions. An extensive audit trail tracks revisions, related entries, and re-refinements with documented remarks and citations.\n\nAutomatic generation of LINK records for covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide bonds is based on set distance criteria, with detailed link data recorded in the struct_conn category. Since June 2021, PDB-format files are not produced for entries with complex beta sheet topologies, but these details are fully captured in mmCIF files. Secondary structure elements are identified automatically by the Promotif algorithm, though author annotations may override these. Validation metrics assess bond lengths, angles, backbone torsions, and other geometric parameters using updated reference data, with deviations flagged above six standard deviations and results documented in mmCIF categories and REMARK 500. Additional entry details like compound function (REMARK 400), polymer sequence (REMARK 999), and ligand information (REMARK 600) are annotated under _pdbx_entry_details; deprecated SITE records are no longer used.\n\nThe wwPDB\u2019s procedures have evolved since 1999 with continual updates, including ligand ID reservations, chain ID policies for cleaved polymers, and biological assembly annotations; the current documented version is 4.5 as of March 2025. Overall, the wwPDB ensures high-quality, standardized data deposition and annotation centered on the robust mmCIF format.\n\nThe accompanying guidelines effective January 2024 through March 2025 establish standards for structure annotation and submission:\n\n1. **Entry Titles and Authorship:** Titles must accurately describe structures and may be modified by staff if ambiguous. Authors can withhold information until public release. Authorship may differ from primary citation authors but generally includes at least one citation author, with principal investigators deciding authorship. Primary citations describe the structure; theses and proceedings are permitted only as primary citations. PubMed IDs, DOIs, and patent IDs are included when available. Unpublished structures use \"not published\" as the journal name. Author suffixes are standardized (e.g., \"Jr.\"), and mixed case formatting mimics literature.\n\n2. **Macromolecule Naming and Source:** Protein names and synonyms align with UniProt, except for precursors, activated forms, fragments, and viral polyproteins. Author-provided names are used if UniProt entries are lacking or hypothetical, with differences reflected in synonyms. Antibodies are named per author detail or according to Fab/IgG fragment conventions. Phage display sources include gene origin and host; cell-free synthesis is uniformly described with genetic modification details. Specific taxonomy IDs identify synthetic and undefined origins. Source organisms and taxonomy IDs derive from NCBI and UniProt, including expression system details.\n\n3. **Polymer Sequences and Fragments:** Polymer chains consist of chemically linked standard or modified residues; peptides require at least three residues with two peptide bonds, nucleic acids at least two linked residues. Carbohydrate polymer residues follow IUPAC/IUBMB conventions from reducing to non-reducing ends, defining the longest branch as main. Fragments denote partial domains or functional regions relative to UniProt sequences.\n\n4. **E.C. Numbers and Mutations:** Enzyme Commission numbers are auto-extracted from UniProt and reconciled with authors if discrepancies arise. Mutations are annotated precisely (e.g., Y20K) and flagged as \"ENGINEERED MUTATION\" in sequence difference records.\n\n5. **Source Organism and Expression Annotation:** Source organisms are identified by scientific names and NCBI taxonomy, categorized as natural, genetically modified, or synthetic, with common names and mixed case formatting consistent with scientific standards. Chimeric proteins specify source organism segments with residue ranges.\n\n6. **Keywords and Functional Annotations:** Author-provided keywords are incorporated in structured records; multifunctional macromolecules have comma-separated keywords, with terms like inhibitors or activators appended as relevant.\n\n7. **Quaternary Assembly and Oligomeric States:** Quaternary structures include software-predicted and author-provided biological assemblies that may differ due to crystal packing or biological data. Oligomeric states range from monomeric (1) up to at least eicosameric (20), named using Greco-Latinate or numeric suffixes indicating subunit count, accommodating homo- and hetero-oligomers. Assembly matrices, surface areas, and thermodynamic data are recorded and reviewed by annotation staff.\n\n8. **File Versioning and Revision History:** Entries receive major-minor version numbers (e.g., 1-0 initial release, 2-0 for major changes like coordinate replacement), with minor updates reflected in minor increments. All versions are retained for historical integrity.\n\nIn conclusion, these standards and procedures enable consistent, comprehensive, and accurate annotation and version control for PDB macromolecular structures, facilitating reliable data sharing and reuse using the advanced, extensible mmCIF format.",

              "content": "The provided text contains a series of FAQs and guidance related to the wwPDB deposition, validation, and refinement process for structural biology data:\n\n1. **Deposition and Validation Systems:**  \n   - The validation server and the OneDep deposition system are separate; validation IDs cannot be used for deposition.  \n   - Depositors must initiate a new deposition at OneDep (http://deposit.wwpdb.org), which generates a distinct deposition ID.  \n   - Communication during deposition is best handled via the OneDep interface\u2019s Communication page.\n\n2. **Validation Reports and Software:**  \n   - The wwPDB uses validation software to assess models after submission; reports become public upon release.  \n   - XML validation files provide machine-readable data corresponding to the PDF report and are publicly available. COOT software can download and highlight validation issues using these files.\n\n3. **Structure Factor Validation - DCC Program:**  \n   - DCC is an internal wwPDB tool for validating structure factor files. It uses refinement programs like Refmac, Phenix, and CNS to calculate R-values.\n\n4. **PDB ID Assignment:**  \n   - PDB IDs are assigned based on submission timestamps; consecutive IDs are not guaranteed. Suggestions to obtain consecutive IDs include submitting multiple depositions quickly during low-traffic periods and completing required fields in advance.\n\n5. **Mandatory Fields and File Preparation:**  \n   - For collection statistics and refinement data, it is recommended to use pdb_extract (http://pdb-extract.wwpdb.org) to prepare files, as it parses data automatically from refinement output and log files.  \n   - Refinement programs like Phenix and REFMAC can produce mmCIF files suitable for direct deposition.  \n   - Depositors cannot upload Phenix or REFMAC mmCIF files lacking refinement statistics and should consult wwPDB guidance on preparing such files.\n\n6. **Metadata and Cross-Repository Data:**  \n   - Although some data may be submitted to other repositories (EMDB, BMRB), wwPDB requires capturing all relevant metadata for validation and entry completeness.\n\n7. **Funding Information Issues:**  \n   - Errors adding funding sources can be resolved by selecting appropriate categories (e.g., \"Other private\" or \"Other government\") and entering grant numbers as requested.\n\n8. **Combining Chemical Shift Files for OneDep:**  \n   - To combine two chemical shift (.str) files: add specific header lines (\"save_assigned_chemical_shifts_1\" or \"\u2026_2\") to the top of each file, then append the second file\u2019s content to the first.\n\n9. **ORCID Requirement:**  \n   - ORCID IDs are mandatory for deposition for all contact authors. Depositurs without ORCID IDs are encouraged to create one quickly at https://orcid.org/.\n\n10. **Common Upload and Validation Issues:**  \n    - Problems such as incorrect file type selection, file permission errors, and partial uploads are often related to network or local issues; solutions include restarting sessions, using different browsers or networks.  \n    - Ligand analysis failures may result from uploading incorrect log files or timeouts; proper file selection or re-uploading can help.  \n    - Sequence alignment errors generally do not block submission.  \n    - EDS validation may fail due to duplicate categories in CIF files, missing data, or refinement software issues, with specific solutions outlined.\n\n11. **Additional Notes on Deposition and Validation:**  \n    - The document references various other topics such as ligand handling, secondary structure information, biological assembly annotation, cryo-EM model deposition, large file uploads, and addressing depositor complaints, highlighting the comprehensive support needed during deposition.\n\nOverall, the text serves as a detailed reference covering procedural, technical, and software-related questions to aid depositors in successfully submitting and validating structural data through wwPDB\u2019s OneDep system.",

Additional information about phage display can be mapped to _entity_src_gen.pdbx_description for example: \u2019Protein selected by phage display\u2019. Cell-free synthesis, in vitro transcription and in vitro translationCell-free synthesis, in vitro transcription and in vitro translation will all be described as \"cell-free synthesis\". Common cell extracts in use today for cell-free protein production are made from E. coli (ECE), rabbit reticulocytes (RRL), wheat germ (WGE), insect cells (ICE)and Yeast Kluyveromyces (the D2P system). All will have genetically manipulated sources (_entity_src_gen category)populated with the above-mentioned source organisms and therelevant taxonomy ids. Other information about the synthesis, such as \"cell-free synthesis\"can be added to the _entity_src_gen.pdbx_description. Baculovirus If a baculovirus was used, it would be listed under the vector type. If a cell line is provided, it will be added to the entry. SyntheticThe term \"synthetic\"means \"synthesized using non biological methods\". Taxonomy ID for synthetic source is 32630. Undefined This term is used for cases when the source organism cannot be identified. Taxonomy ID for undefined source is 32644.3. Polymer sequences and sequence database reference assignmentWhat is the definition of polymer sequence (entity_poly, SEQRES)? The polymer sequence is a list of the consecutive chemical components covalently linked in alinear fashion to form a polymer. The chemical components included in this listing may be standard or modified amino acid or nucleic acid residues. It may also include other residues that are linked to the standard backbone in the polymer. Chemical components or groupscovalently linked to the side chains of peptides or groups linked to sugars and/or bases in nucleic acid polymers will not be listed here.Proteins containing three or more residues, forming two consecutive standard peptide bonds, in the same direction will be assigned polymer sequence records (molecule name, source, sequence, sequence database reference).Nucleic acids containing two or more residues linked by standard nucleotide bonds will be ",

Only depositions where your ORCID is listed for a contact author will appear in your session summary. If your deposition was created before ORCID login implementation, it might not be linked to your ORCID account yet. In such cases, contact RCSB PDB support staff for assistance linking your existing deposition to your ORCID. Also, verify that you have completed email verification when first using ORCID login, as this step is required to create or access sessions via ORCID [ID:1][ID:2].",

How do I retrieve my password?In order to retrieve your password, please click the \"Forgot Password\"button located on the left-handpanel (\"Existing Deposition\")of the deposition page. You will be prompted for your Deposition ID and e-mail address. When you have provided this information, your password will be e-mailed to you. In orderto maintain security and con\ufb01dentiality of the on-hold submissions, passwords are only sent to thoseemail addresses that were added to the contact information at the time of deposition. The email addressneeds to be an exact match of what is currently present in the deposition i.e. email aliases will be treatedas a di\ufb00erent email address and hence you won't receive the password.I did not receive an email containing my password after attempting to retrieve my password. Whymight this have happened?There are several possible reasons: (1)There was a typo in the email address or/and deposition ID thatwere provided; (2)the email address provided for password retrieval is not associated with the depositionsession; (3)the email was \ufb01ltered into the spam folder. Deposition-related email messages are sent fromnoreply@mail.wwpdb.org; you may need to adjust your mail settings so that this address is not \ufb01ltered.Can I reset or change my password?At this time, deposition session passwords cannot be reset or changed. We will implement this feature inour future updates.How do I add an author to an entry or citation author list?Click the \"+\"button next to the author name after which the new author name is to be placed. This willadd a new blank form for new author's name. To reorder the author list, drag the up/down arrow icons.Choose the trashcan icon to remove a name from the list.How long will my deposition session be saved?Un-submitted sessions will expire 3 months after last login. Un-submitted sessions and uploaded \ufb01leswill be removed once they expire.Where can I designate my deposition for structure prediction competition?At \"Release Status\"page, set \"Y\"to designate your deposition for prediction target, then select a properdevelopment method such as CASP for the prediction if it has sequence identity to available structuresbelow 50% or you expect it to be interesting for prediction otherwise.How do I provide information for a re-re\ufb01ned structure of an alternative interpretation using the",

First-time OneDep contact authors will need to verify their email address beforebeing able to create new depositions, this address does not have to be the same as the one registeredwithin ORCiD, and can be updated in future. Once logged-in using ORCiD, OneDep returns a summarytable of the entries in which the ORCiD has been provided for the contact author. Users can furtheraccess each of their entries\u2019deposition interfaces without the need to login again using a deposition IDor password. The option of \u2018Start a new deposition\u2019is provided beneath the summary table of existingsessions. You will need to select your country/region from a drop-down menu and then be redirected tothe wwPDB member\u2019s deposition site corresponding to your location. Follow the procedures on thepage, once the new session is created, a noti\ufb01cation will be sent to the veri\ufb01ed email address associatedwith your ORCiD, with the deposition ID and the randomly assigned password.

The system also accepts PDB format files, which are automatically converted to PDBx/mmCIF during deposition, but large structures exceeding 99,999 atoms or 62 chains must use PDBx/mmCIF. Structure factor files can be submitted in mmCIF or mtz formats. For NMR data, restraint files typically use the NMR-STAR format.

To ensure that all wwPDB and related deposition tools function with minimal loss of data fidelity,depositors should output PDBx/mmCIF format files from their refinement program, if supported. A PDBx/mmCIF preparation guide is available. The format requirements for depositing structures are as follows: Coordinates and meta-data PDBx/mmCIF format: Deposition can be prepared in PDBx/mmCIF exchange format.

Depositors are advised to submit structure coordinate files in the PDBx/mmCIF format for maximal data fidelity, supported by detailed format guides. Structure factors can be submitted in mmCIF or mtz format, and NMR restraint data typically use the NMR-STAR format.\n\nAccepted depositions include biological macromolecules such as polypeptides (minimum three residues for biologically relevant peptides; synthetic polypeptides require at least 24 residues), polynucleotides, and polysaccharides (each requiring at least four residues). Small peptides or molecules not meeting these criteria should be deposited to alternative repositories like the CCDC or BMRB. Previously deposited molecules not meeting current guidelines remain in the archive. Experimental structures determined by methods unsupported by the PDB are reviewed by experts before acceptance, and purely theoretical models are no longer accepted since October 15, 2006.\n\nRe-refined structures can be deposited only if accompanied by a peer-reviewed publication describing the re-refinement; early deposition prior to publication is possible but processing and release will be delayed until publication. A specific remark linking to the original PDB entry must be included.\n\nAuthorship of PDB entries is classified into Entry Authors (led by the Principal Investigator or Team Leader overseeing the research), Contact Authors (handle deposition and communication with wwPDB), and Citation Authors.\n\nStructural data from various experimental methods\u2014including X-ray crystallography, NMR, electron microscopy, neutron diffraction, powder diffraction, and fiber diffraction\u2014are accepted if molecules meet size criteria. For crystallography, complete asymmetric unit coordinates must be provided; in cases of high symmetry assemblies, partial coordinates with NCS matrices are acceptable. Integrative structures combining multiple data sources and methods can be submitted through PDB-IHM, requiring detailed metadata such as starting models, restraints, protocols, and citations.\n\nMandatory deposition of experimental data began in stages: structure factors and NMR restraints since February 1, 2008; EM map volumes since September 5, 2016; and NMR chemical shift data since December 6, 2020. X-ray structures require full B factors for all atoms, including conversion from TLS-derived values and inclusion of ANISOU records where TLS is used.\n\nIn some cases, structures determined before mandatory experimental data deposition or lacking available data may still be accepted if supported by peer-reviewed publications before January 1, 2008, and if the sequences or ligands are novel to the PDB archive.\n\nAll depositions are managed via the OneDep system through wwPDB partner sites such as RCSB and PDBe.

The only exceptions are models that produce highly symmetric assemblies (e.g., viruses, helical symmetry, etc.)in which only a portion of the asymmetric unit is used in refinement. Depositors must provide the model in the standard crystal frame along with the NCS matrices. For microscopy methods, if symmetry operators are required to create the complete biological assembly from the modeled coordinates, such operators must be provided.Example: in PDB entry 2wbh, the complete MS2 bacteriophage capsid biological assembly is generated from the three deposited chains (A, B, C)by applying the 60 operators provided in_pdbx_struct_oper_list (REMARK 350)records.

APDBx/mmCIF (/deposition/preparing-pdbx-mmcif-\ufb01les)preparation guide is available.For large structures generated using exact symmetry operations (e.g., strict helical, point, or non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS)), authors should deposit only those chains that were \ufb01tted and/orre\ufb01ned and supply a PDB \ufb01le containing the operators (matrix transformations)that can be used togenerate the complete assembly.File UploadHow do I upload \ufb01les for deposition? Which \ufb01les are required for deposition?Go to \"Upload \ufb01les\"page of the deposition interface. Select one coordinate \ufb01le using \"browse\"buttonand choose a proper \ufb01le type (PDB or mmCIF).Select experimental data \ufb01le(s)using \"browse\"button again and choose a proper \ufb01le type (e.g., mmCIFor mtz for structure factors).Follow the instructions provided on the \ufb01le upload page regarding which \ufb01le types are required fordeposition. Press \"Continue deposition\"button at the bottom to proceed with the deposition.X-ray depositions require one coordinate \ufb01le and one structure factor \ufb01le.NMR depositions require one coordinate \ufb01le, one chemical shift \ufb01le, and at least one restraint \ufb01le.Depositors are also encouraged to upload a peak list \ufb01le.",

              "content": "On occasion, the wwPDB is asked to archive a structure that was determined before deposition of experimental data became mandatory and the experimental data are no longer available. It is difficult to validate such structures without experimental data.In such cases, the wwPDB Directors/Heads will determine if the structure can be deposited tothe PDB. Criteria for accepting structures determined by experimental methods but without experimental data are as follows: there is a peer-reviewed publication prior to January 1st 2008 describing the corresponding structure(s)and either the polymer sequence and/or entities are not represented in the PDB archive or the deposition includes one or more ligand(s)notcurrently represented in the PDB Chemical Component Dictionary.Deposition of integrative structures Integrative structures of biological macromolecular systems are computed by combining different types of information, including varied experimental data, physical theories,statistical preferences, and/or prior models. Experimental data can be produced by traditional structure determination methods (i.e., macromolecular X-ray crystallography(MX), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)spectroscopy, and three-dimensional Electron Microscopy (3DEM)), as well as other biophysical and proteomics methods such as small angle scattering (SAS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), chemicalcrosslinking with mass spectrometry, F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)spectroscopy, and Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange (HDX)with mass spectrometry or NMR spectroscopy.The PDB accepts integrative structures of biological macromolecules that are at least partly based on experimental data, via the PDB-IHM (PDB-Dev)system. An integrative structure can be depicted using a flexible model representation, including ensembles ofmulti-scale, multi-state, and ordered models. In addition to atomic and/or coarse-grainedcoordinates of the modeled system, the deposition needs to include starting models,spatial restraints, modeling protocols, as well as specific metadata information (e.g., citations, authors, software, relevant data in external repositories, and referencesequence information).What types of experimentally-determined structures are accepted by the wwPDB? Since October 15, 2006, PDB depositions have been restricted to atomic coordinates that aresubstantially determined by experimental measurements on actual sample specimens containing biological macromolecules1. Currently, coordinate sets produced by X-ray crystallography, NMR,",

Users must enter complete contact author information and finalize submissions by reviewing and accepting validation reports; submissions are blocked until this is done. Files can be replaced pre-submission via the system, while post-submission replacements require contacting a biocurator. Depositions expire after three months of inactivity.\n\nLigands must match the Chemical Component Dictionary or be accompanied by detailed chemical information. Ligand data, including images and definition files, should be provided on the ligand verification page. File upload errors related to incorrect types or missing data must be corrected by re-uploading. Coordinate files of released entries can be updated once per year per entry and up to three times per Principal Investigator yearly, but experimental data cannot be altered.\n\nDepositors can manage authorship and indicate structure prediction targets. Support and feedback are available through the Communication page. The system supports large entries exceeding 99,999 atoms or 62 chains via PDBx/mmCIF format, requires TER records after each polymer chain, and offers tools such as pdb_extract and SF-tool to assist preparation. Login options include deposition ID/password and ORCiD authentication.\n\nHybrid methods and raw experimental data depositions are supported, with encouragement to deposit raw data in specialized curated archives linked via DOIs. Re-refinement submissions require referencing the original PDB ID. Required deposition data encompasses polymer sequences, ligand information, and processing logs, with software details updateable post-submission. Multiple related entries can be efficiently deposited by copying existing data.\n\nAtomic coordinate data include ATOM and HETATM records for polymers and ligands (e.g., histidine, alanine, glycerol), with occupancy and B-factors recorded.

ORCiD-linked sessions allow easy management of multiple depositions. Users can deposit hybrid method structures by selecting multiple experimental methods, and accession codes for each method are assigned upon submission.\n\nRaw experimental data depositions are encouraged in appropriate curated archives (e.g., ProteinDiffraction.org for X-ray data) with corresponding DOI references added in the OneDep interface. For re-refinement using existing experimental data, the original PDB ID must be provided, and the content_type set as \"re-refinement.\"\n\nDuring deposition, required information includes protein/nucleic acid sequences (from databases like UniProtKB or BLAST), ligand information (via Ligand Expo), and processing log files. Missing software names for data processing can be submitted via the Communication page for update. The system supports depositing many related entries efficiently by copying data from a previous deposition using its Deposition ID and password.\n\nFor electron microscopy data and NMR raw data, depositors are directed to specialized resources such as EM Data Resource, EMPIAR, or BMRB. Depositors can provide DOIs for raw image datasets via the \"Related Entries\" page.\n\nOverall, the OneDep system streamlines structural data deposition by providing comprehensive tools, conversion utilities, and flexible login options while ensuring compliance with format requirements and encouraging raw data archiving for reproducibility and transparency.",

Depositors are advised to submit structure coordinate files in the PDBx/mmCIF format for maximal data fidelity, supported by detailed format guides. Structure factors can be submitted in mmCIF or mtz format, and NMR restraint data typically use the NMR-STAR format.\n\nAccepted depositions include biological macromolecules such as polypeptides (minimum three residues for biologically relevant peptides; synthetic polypeptides require at least 24 residues), polynucleotides, and polysaccharides (each requiring at least four residues). Small peptides or molecules not meeting these criteria should be deposited to alternative repositories like the CCDC or BMRB. Previously deposited molecules not meeting current guidelines remain in the archive. Experimental structures determined by methods unsupported by the PDB are reviewed by experts before acceptance, and purely theoretical models are no longer accepted since October 15, 2006.\n\nRe-refined structures can be deposited only if accompanied by a peer-reviewed publication describing the re-refinement; early deposition prior to publication is possible but processing and release will be delayed until publication. A specific remark linking to the original PDB entry must be included.\n\nAuthorship of PDB entries is classified into Entry Authors (led by the Principal Investigator or Team Leader overseeing the research), Contact Authors (handle deposition and communication with wwPDB), and Citation Authors.\n\nStructural data from various experimental methods\u2014including X-ray crystallography, NMR, electron microscopy, neutron diffraction, powder diffraction, and fiber diffraction\u2014are accepted if molecules meet size criteria. For crystallography, complete asymmetric unit coordinates must be provided; in cases of high symmetry assemblies, partial coordinates with NCS matrices are acceptable. Integrative structures combining multiple data sources and methods can be submitted through PDB-IHM, requiring detailed metadata such as starting models, restraints, protocols, and citations.\n\nMandatory deposition of experimental data began in stages: structure factors and NMR restraints since February 1, 2008; EM map volumes since September 5, 2016; and NMR chemical shift data since December 6, 2020. X-ray structures require full B factors for all atoms, including conversion from TLS-derived values and inclusion of ANISOU records where TLS is used.\n\nIn some cases, structures determined before mandatory experimental data deposition or lacking available data may still be accepted if supported by peer-reviewed publications before January 1, 2008, and if the sequences or ligands are novel to the PDB archive.\n\nAll depositions are managed via the OneDep system through wwPDB partner sites such as RCSB and PDBe. The wwPDB documents processing policies and exceptions are reviewed case-by-case by the wwPDB Directors.",

Structural data from experimental methods (X-ray, NMR, EM) are submitted to the PDB, theoretical models to Model Archive, and integrative/hybrid models to pdb-dev. Corrections to released entries follow specific rules, with new PDB IDs required if structure factors change and limited coordinate updates allowed annually. Metadata tied to annotations can only be changed through requests via OneDep. The system supports bulk depositions, legacy structure submissions (pre-2008), and enforces entry holding limits of one year with reminders before potential withdrawal.\n\n2. **Refinement, Validation, and Specific Data Types:**  \nMandatory data include full atomic B-factors and detailed TLS refinement information; twinned crystal data require proper indicators and corresponding structure factors. Validation reports are generated separately and publicly accessible. Cryo-EM deposits, especially large files (>3GB), have defined submission workflows favoring shared Box folders over FTP; specialized workflows exist for map-only deposits. Proper submission of raw half-maps is essential for validation, and composite maps require both focused refinement components and consensus maps with processing pauses until EMDB consensus IDs are provided. EM raw 2D data and SEM images must be submitted to EMPIAR and BioImage Archive, respectively.\n\n3. **Submission Tools, Workflows, and Authentication:**  \nUtilities such as pdb_extract and SF-tool aid file preparation and legacy format conversion. Only one active deposition session per user is allowed, with unsubmitted sessions expiring after three months. Communication with wwPDB is managed through session communication tools or ticketing systems like OeDep and RT for triage and query handling. Current OneDep authentication uses shared passwords per session, recognized as insecure; an ORCID-based system is under development, allowing ORCID-logged depositors to bypass passwords. COVID-19 entries can request immediate release via formal letters.\n\n4. **Biological Assemblies, Sequences, and Ligands:**  \nAssemblies are defined by polymer chain counts supported by experimental evidence. Chain IDs and residue numbering may be standardized or updated by wwPDB during processing. Alternate conformations share chain and residue IDs but differ in alternate location identifiers. Unknown or ambiguous sequences are modeled as poly-Alanine or poly-UNK with final sequences assigned during processing. Ligands require comprehensive chemical descriptions, including covalent bonds and modifications; obsolete or modified residues are standardized and merged to ensure annotation quality.\n\n5. **NMR Data and Publications:**  \nOnly chemical-shift-based NMR models with restraints are accepted; chemical shift-only or restraint-only models are submitted elsewhere (PDB-Dev). Tools like STARch facilitate required NMR data file generation. PDB attempts automated publication matching but relies on depositor and journal notifications for corrections. Accurate contact author ORCID IDs and funding information are mandatory.\n\n6. **Operational Procedures and Policies:**  \nBiocurators handle depositor communications via structured ticketing systems, ensuring proper triage, escalation, and response with archiving of all correspondence. Weekly triage shifts cover continuous support with handoff protocols. Advertising unrelated services in deposit-help channels is prohibited. Entry holdings have strict time limits, with reminders issued before withdrawal.\n\nOverall, the documents establish robust, coordinated protocols for the deposition, validation, authentication, and management of macromolecular structural data within the global wwPDB network, emphasizing data integrity, standardization, reproducibility, and efficient communication, including tailored procedures for COVID-19-related submissions.",

              "content": "The provided text contains multiple Q&A style guidance and policies related to structure deposition and management in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and related archives:\n\n1. **Theoretical vs Experimental Models**: PDB primarily accepts structures derived from experimental data (X-ray, NMR, EM). Theoretical or computational models should be deposited in the Model Archive (https://www.modelarchive.org). Integrative or hybrid models based on other biophysical data can be deposited at pdb-dev (https://pdb-dev.wwpdb.org/about/).\n\n2. **Replacing Coordinates for Released Entries**: \n   - Option 1: Submit a new deposition with a new PDB ID which will obsolete the old entry; mandatory if structure factors are changed.\n   - Option 2: Upload corrected coordinates for released entries deposited via OneDep, with restrictions: only coordinate and metadata changes allowed (no structure factors); only one correction per year per entry; each Principal Investigator (PI) can correct up to three entries per year this way.\n\n3. **Refinement Software and Data Challenges**: Differences in refinement software versions (e.g., REFMAC changes in CCP4 7.0) and incomplete recording of all refinement parameters lead to challenges in reproducing depositor refinement results. Complex structure factor files and use of special parameters like wavelength data can add difficulty.\n\n4. **Metadata Changes Post-Annotation**: Some metadata (e.g., macromolecule name, source, expression system) tightly linked to the annotation process cannot be altered by depositors directly after annotation. Requests should be made via the communication tab within the deposition interface.\n\n5. **Entry Release and Publication Matching**: \n   - PDB tries to automatically match deposition citations to publications, but low similarity between tentative and final citation titles can prevent automatic recognition.\n   - Authors, journals, and users are encouraged to notify PDB of the publication of primary citations referencing PDB entries.\n\n6. **Re-uploading Coordinates with Different Chain IDs or Numbers**: Changing polymer chain IDs or the number of chains requires resetting the deposition interface. After an initial failed upload attempt, a second upload with deselected old files triggers a reset option to incorporate new coordinates.\n\n7. **Depositing Multiple Structures**: \n   - Use pdb_extract (http://pdb-extract.wwpdb.org) to prepare files efficiently.\n   - Upload coordinate and structure factor files from the final refinement round; adding LOG/output files allows automatic parsing of collection statistics and refinement data.\n   - Deposit the first of multiple related entries with complete information, then use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option to import metadata into subsequent depositions, minimizing manual input.\n   - Multiple depositions can be started independently but only one session can be active per user at a time.\n\n8. **Generating PDB Accession-Ready Files**: \n   - Recent versions of refinement software (Pheix, REFMAC, Buster) generate PDBx/mmCIF files suitable for direct deposition.\n   - Instructions and tools are available at software-specific sites and wwPDB\u2019s preparation pages (https://www.wwpdb.org/deposition/preparing-pdbx-mmcif-files).\n   - For other software users, wwPDB provides standalone and web-based tools like pdb_extract to convert legacy PDB format files to PDBx/mmCIF.\n\n9. **Communication and Submission Interface Usage**: Depositors are encouraged to use the deposition interface communication tab for requests and queries to ensure proper tracking and handling.\n\n10. **Additional Topics Mentioned** (not elaborated in the text): Guidance on experimental methods (EM, NMR), handling validation reports, deposition of composite and half maps, handling large numbers of depositions (group depositions), dealing with chemical shift files for NMR, and other technical and policy-related matters.\n\nOverall, the text serves as a comprehensive FAQ and policy overview addressing common depositor questions on submission processes, structure types accepted, correction procedures, metadata edits, file preparation, and related administrative aspects within the PDB deposition ecosystem.",

Obsoleted entries remain accessible with references and redirects to superseding entries. Metadata and nomenclature are regularly updated without altering coordinates; coordinate updates retain the same PDB ID and are released immediately, while changes to experimental data require new depositions and PDB IDs. Authorship is clearly defined, with principal investigators responsible for submission approval and notification of retractions. Since September 24, 2021, principal investigators' names, emails, and ORCiD IDs are public upon release. Re-refined entries must cite original datasets, carry a \"REFI\" status until publication, and have documented procedures for transparency.\n\nEntry release is coordinated with authors, journals, and the community. Authors must approve curated entries before release; if no response occurs within three weeks post-validation and no issues are found, entries are automatically approved upon publication availability. Authors may withdraw unreleased entries, archived with a withdrawn (WDRN) status. Problematic entries are resolved with authors or withdrawn/released with caveats after one year without publication.\n\nCoordinate and experimental data are released weekly under three statuses: REL (immediate release after approval), HPUB (held until publication or one year), and HOLD (held up to one year). Release or correction requests must be submitted by Thursday noon local time; late requests roll to the next cycle. Released data are packaged by RCSB-PDB and synchronized weekly across wwPDB FTP sites, with online updates Saturdays and sequence/ligand data Wednesdays UTC. Unreleased data remain accessible only to authors, with limited public metadata by permission; reviewers cannot access unreleased data but may request validation reports.\n\nPDB IDs and ligand codes are assigned automatically upon deposition completion and may be modified by wwPDB. Authors can update data prior to release and submit revisions until release deadlines. Post-release minor and major updates occur via the PDB versioning system. Specialized portals (PDBe, PDBj for NMR; BMRB for supplemental NMR; PDB-IHM for integrative/hybrid structures) are provided. Depositors are encouraged to use the PDBx/mmCIF format for structural data.\n\nAccepted depositions include biological macromolecules: polypeptides (minimum three residues; synthetic polypeptides require at least 24 residues), polynucleotides, and polysaccharides (minimum four residues). Smaller peptides or molecules should be submitted to other repositories such as CCDC or BMRB. Structures from unsupported experimental methods undergo expert review; purely theoretical models have not been accepted since October 15, 2006.\n\nRe-refined structures must be accompanied by peer-reviewed publications referencing the original PDB entry. Deposits prior to publication are processed but not released until published. Authorship categories include Entry Authors (led by principal investigators), Contact Authors (manage deposition communication), and Citation Authors.\n\nStructural data from various methods\u2014X-ray crystallography, NMR, electron microscopy, neutron, powder, and fiber diffraction\u2014are accepted if molecules meet size criteria. X-ray deposits must include full asymmetric unit coordinates; partial coordinates and NCS matrices are allowed for high-symmetry assemblies. Integrative structures from multiple methods are submitted via PDB-IHM, requiring detailed metadata.\n\nMandatory deposition of experimental data began in phases: structure factors and NMR restraints since February 1, 2008; EM map volumes since September 5, 2016; and NMR chemical shifts since December 6, 2020. X-ray structures must include full B factors and ANISOU records where applicable. Older structures without mandatory data may still be accepted if supported by peer-reviewed publications prior to January 1, 2008, especially if sequences or ligands are novel.\n\nAll depositions are managed through the OneDep system at wwPDB partner sites (e.g., RCSB, PDBe) with documented processing policies; exceptions are reviewed case-by-case by wwPDB Directors.",

Contact authors, especially principal investigators or team leaders, have final authority on entry content and are publicly identified upon release with names, emails, and ORCID IDs.

Given the complex nature of some of the issues that can arise during processing, exceptions to policy are considered on a case-by-case basis by the wwPDB Directors/Heads.The two sections in the complete document are: A: wwPDB policies B: wwPDB processing procedures Further information about these sections is available in the introduction to each section.Sept. 2021: major version 5.0, make contact info for entry PI(s)public.1 PDB Entry RequirementsWhat are the requirements of acceptance of an entry to the PDB?OneDep depositions The wwPDB will accept all experimentally determined structures of biological macromoleculesthat meet the minimum requirements. These requirements include: three-dimensional atomic coordinates, information about the composition of the structure (studied sample sequence(s), source organism(s), molecule name(s), chemistry, etc.), information about the experiment performed, details of the structure determination steps and author contact information are also necessary for the deposition. In addition, structure factor or intensity data are required for X-ray submissions, restraints and chemical shifts are required for NMR submissions. Map volumedeposition to EMDB is mandatory for PDB depositions of 3DEM models. If the experimental data deposited with the model coordinates does not follow traditional processing procedures then raw data should be made available by providing a DOI assigned by the existing archives for raw experimental data (eg SBGrid or IRRMC).Mandatory X-ray structure factor data and NMR restraint data deposition started from Feb 1st, 2008. Mandatory NMR chemical shift data deposition started from Dec 6th, 2020. MandatoryEM map volume deposition started from Sep 5th, 2016.For structures determined by X-ray crystallography, all atoms must have full B factors. If TLS was used during refinement, the residual B factors must be converted to full B factors. All atoms described by TLS records must have associated ANISOU records.",

              "content": "The document presents comprehensive, detailed guidelines and standards for the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) concerning the processing, annotation, validation, versioning, and archival of biomolecular structural data as of March 2025 (Version 4.5). Key points include:\n\n1. **Entry Metadata and Citation**: Entry titles must be clear and may be edited by wwPDB staff; author lists are decided by principal investigators and can differ from publication authors. Primary citations include PubMed and DOI identifiers when available, and unpublished or patented structures are annotated accordingly. Author names follow standard abbreviations and title capitalization.\n\n2. **Macromolecule Naming and Function**: Protein names are standardized primarily using UniProt data, with specific rules for precursors, fragments, chimeras, and antibodies. Protein functional categorization uses enzyme commission (E.C.) numbers when available and a wide range of functional keywords. When functions are unknown, generic designations like \u201cUNKNOWN FUNCTION\u201d or \u201cputative\u201d enzyme classes are applied.\n\n3. **Structure Files and Formats**: Large structures exceeding 99,999 ATOM lines are stored as single PDBx/mmCIF files with additional minimal PDB format TAR files for compatibility; these have a compatibility flag set to \"N\". Complex beta-sheet topologies not representable in PDB format are supported in PDBx/mmCIF format only.\n\n4. **Biological Assemblies and Quaternary Structure**: Assemblies combine author input and software analyses (e.g., PISA), differentiating biological from crystal packing assemblies. Details on assembly transformations, interfaces, and energetics are annotated. Oligomeric states are named with Greek/Latin numeric prefixes for 1\u201320 subunits and numerically beyond, counting polypeptides \u22653 amino acids or nucleic acids \u22652 nucleotides as subunits.\n\n5. **Electron Microscopy Data**: EM structures (single particle, helical, tomography, subtomogram averaging) and electron crystallography (EC) are supported with associated 3D volume maps, atomic coordinates, and structure factors (for EC). Atomic coordinate deposition requires prior or simultaneous release of the corresponding EM map, identified by EMDB IDs.\n\n6. **Complex Assemblies and Symmetry**: Viral capsids and other complex assemblies utilize non-crystallographic symmetry transformations (e.g., 60 matrices for icosahedral viruses). Assemblies are aligned to standard frames and documented with symmetry metadata covering point and helical symmetries.\n\n7. **Validation and Annotation**: Validation includes updated target values for bond lengths and angles (Engh & Huber for proteins, Parkinson et al. for nucleic acids). Deviations >6\u00d7 standard are flagged. Metrics cover contacts, torsions, peptide isomerizations, planarity, and chirality, recorded in mmCIF categories and REMARK 500. Covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide links are annotated using standard cutoff distances and detailed atom/residue records.\n\n8. **Polymer and Sequence Standards**: Polymer sequences require minimum lengths (\u22653 amino acids with two consecutive peptide bonds for proteins; \u22652 nucleotides for nucleic acids). Carbohydrate residues are ordered from reducing to non-reducing ends per IUPAC/IUBMB rules, defining main chains in branched structures. Fragment domains within proteins are annotated.\n\n9. **Source Organism and Expression Systems**: Organism origins use scientific names and taxonomy IDs predominantly from NCBI, with UniProt references. Metadata include gene source, host organism, cell line, tissue, and subcellular location. Expression systems span bacterial (*E. coli*, taxid 562), mouse (10090), human (9606), synthetic sources, phage display, cell-free methods, and baculovirus systems, each with specific annotation requirements.\n\n10. **Mutation and Versioning**: Engineered mutations are precisely annotated using standard notation (e.g., Y20K) and correctly tagged. Entries carry version identifiers (major-minor) with the initial Structure of Record as 1-0; major versions reflect significant coordinate or sequence updates, minor versions cover other revisions; all versions are retained with latest minors.\n\n11. **Historical Updates and Data Re-refinement**: The document tracks major procedural changes since 1999, including chain ID standards updated in 2023\u20132025 and biological assembly annotation revisions since 2018. Entries re-refining prior data include explicit REMARK 0 citations referencing original entries and publications.\n\n12. **Additional Annotations and Data Management**: Functional details, ligand info, related entries, and reuse of experimental data are documented in designated metadata categories and remarks. Some site records (_struct_site and _struct_site_gen) ceased generation for new entries after June 2021. Audit categories log detailed revision histories and providers.\n\nOverall, the guidelines ensure rigorous, standardized, and transparent annotation and archival of biomolecular structural data, facilitating data consistency, interoperability, and clear linkage between coordinate models and supporting experimental evidence across the wwPDB consortium.",

              "content": "The provided documents offer comprehensive guidance and operational procedures related to the management of macromolecular structure data depositions within the wwPDB system, emphasizing COVID-19 immediate release processes, depositor account security, file handling, communication protocols, and biocurator triage duties.\n\nKey summaries include:\n\n1. **COVID-19 Immediate Release and Depositor Access:**  \n   - An official letter from Principal Investigators supports expedited COVID-19 structure releases.  \n   - The current OneDep system uses a single shared password per deposition, posing security risks. A transition to an ORCID-based identity system is underway, allowing contact authors with ORCID IDs password-free access and individual authentication.  \n   - No mechanism currently exists to change shared passwords; updating contact emails requires modifying specific database fields and resetting the system.\n\n2. **File Management and Troubleshooting:**  \n   - Common upload failures arise from non-ASCII characters or unsupported compression formats (other than .gz).  \n   - Selecting incorrect file types during upload can lead to subtle validation errors.  \n   - Deposit files are stored in structured directories separating production, archive, temporary uploads, processing areas, validation servers, and legacy data, mostly segregated by server location (East/West Coast).  \n   - Post-deposition workflows involve batch calculation results stored in designated directories requiring periodic updates.\n\n3. **Depositor Support and Policies:**  \n   - Depositors struggling with failed uploads or password issues receive step-by-step reset instructions.  \n   - Extensions of hold periods on data release are generally granted only if the primary publication is submitted; otherwise, withdrawal and re-deposition offer a renewed hold interval.  \n   - Entries held beyond one year without updates or release are withdrawn per policy, with notifications sent to depositors.\n\n4. **ORCID Requirements and Author Identification:**  \n   - Contact authors must have ORCID IDs for communication and verification; structure authors might include additional collaborators optionally with ORCIDs.  \n   - Many journals now mandate ORCID inclusion where available.\n\n5. **Entry Handling and Communication Channels:**  \n   - Entries originating from PDBe or PDBj have dedicated communication pathways within the OneDep system, not direct email.  \n   - Structural quality concerns are referred back to depositors or peer reviewers; wwPDB biocurators do not evaluate or guide on structure quality or predictive models.  \n   - For publication delays, depositors are urged to approve release by a specified date to enable earliest public availability.  \n   - Various tools and resources, including genomic mapping and PDB APIs, facilitate data integration and usage.\n\n6. **Permissions and Use of Data:**  \n   - Molecular images on RCSB PDB are freely available for commercial and non-commercial use with proper citation to authors and RCSB PDB.  \n   - Unpublished structure data can be referenced via DOI-style URLs that activate upon release; an equivalent system for EMDB data is currently unavailable.\n\n7. **Depositing Legacy Data and Group Submissions:**  \n   - Structures determined before mandatory experimental data deposition (pre-2008) may be accepted if they meet specific criteria and receive Director approval.  \n   - Large group depositions (e.g., over 100 related structures) are accommodated.\n\n8. **Email and Helpdesk Management:**  \n   - Guidance is provided for whitelisting wwPDB email domains to prevent messages being marked as spam.  \n   - Deposit-related inquiries should funnel through designated help desks listed on the wwPDB contact page.\n\n9. **Biocurator Triage Procedures:**  \n   - Triage annotators monitor multiple email and system-based communication channels to appropriately route inquiries related to depositions and validation issues.  \n   - They identify query ownership using session IDs and system status tools, forwarding issues to assigned annotators or partner organizations as needed.  \n   - Simple validation questions may be answered directly; complex ones are escalated.  \n   - All correspondence tied to specific depositions is archived in a centralized RT ticket system to ensure traceability.  \n   - The RT system is used to track, assign, and manage tickets; spam is deleted promptly.  \n   - Triage duties follow a weekly rotation with clear sign-off protocols and notifications to ensure continuous coverage.\n\n10. **General Communication Rules:**  \n    - Users are encouraged to use the OneDep communication tool for deposit-specific queries to aid archiving and reduce workload.  \n    - Deposit-help is not to be used for advertising; RCSB website-related questions are redirected to designated contacts.  \n    - Collaborative coordination among wwPDB partners ensures inquiries are routed correctly and efficiently.\n\nOverall, these documents emphasize ongoing improvement of depositor security through ORCID integration, clear protocols for file and data management, thorough user support mechanisms, and detailed triage workflows to uphold efficient and effective operations within the wwPDB deposition and annotation environment.",

If no reply is received within three weeks after the validation report is made available to the authors,the wwPDB will consider the entry to have been approved by the authors. If at that point thereare no outstanding issues2 with the entry, the entry will be released. For entries with outstandingissues see the Problem Structures section below. Entries can be released without citation information and updated with this information at a later date.HPUB/HOLD entries will be released either when release is requested by the authors or by a journal, or when the wwPDB becomes aware of a publication describing the entry.HPUB/HOLD entries cannot be held for more than one year beyond the date of deposition. If an entry remains unreleased at the end of the hold period, it must either be released or withdrawn. Ten months following deposition, the wwPDB will communicate with the authors of unreleasedentries, asking whether they wish to release or withdraw the entry before the one-year anniversary of the deposition date.The wwPDB promotes open science and immediate release of data when associated publications appear online (identified by detection of wwPDB Core Archive [PDB, EMDB,BMRB]accession codes in those publications). wwPDB policies state that if a wwPDB CoreArchive database accession code is identified in a publication (pre-print or peer-reviewed)the on Hold for Publication entry will be released. If a Depositor has questions or concerns regarding a specific entry, she/he should directly contact the leader of the appropriate wwPDB data center. Any revision of the PDB entry following release will be managed under the PDB 2 Note: Any issues that arise during annotation that prevent the standard processing of submissions are considered to be outstanding issues.

Obsoleted entries include a citation to the retraction and remain publicly accessible; users searching for obsolete entries are redirected to superseding entries if available. The wwPDB regularly reviews and remediates the archive for consistency, updating metadata and nomenclature without altering coordinate data, assigning version numbers to files, and maintaining older versions on their FTP site.\n\nContact Authors, including the PI or Team Leader equivalent, must be correctly designated by the depositor and are notified of any changes or obsoletions. In conflicts, the PI/Team Leader has final decision authority. Entry Authors include the PI/Team Leader and all contributors to the structural determination as designated by the PI/Team Leader, and they must approve the final data before submission. For entries deposited or revised after September 24, 2021, principal investigators\u2019 names, emails, and ORCiD IDs are publicly available upon release.\n\nCitation Authors appear on the primary publication and may differ from Entry Authors. For re-refined entries, the original data and entry must be cited; such entries can be deposited before publication but won\u2019t be released until the publication is public. Updates to coordinates retain the same PDB ID and are versioned; however, changes to experimental data require new depositions with new PDB IDs, and the old entries are obsoleted but remain accessible. Released structures cannot be withdrawn. When entries are obsoleted without superseding replacements, a reason must be clearly stated in the entry metadata.",

Structure authors may include additional persons who are not required to have ORCIDs but having them helps distinguish authors with the same name. Some journals now request ORCID where available.\n\n2. **Handling Entries from PDBe or PDBj (IDs starting D_12XXXXXXXX or D_13XXXXXXXX)**: Questions regarding these entries should be directed to respective colleagues at PDBe or PDBj through their communication systems within OneDep, not via email.\n\n3. **Annotation and Entry Processing**: Clarification on bound ligands requires chemical names and structures of ligands before binding. Structural quality complaints are generally redirected to the depositors or expert peer reviewers since wwPDB biocurators do not judge structure quality or provide guidance on predicted models.\n\n4. **Publication and Release Requests**: If publication of a primary citation is impeded, depositors are requested to approve the structure release by a specified date to enable earliest release.\n\n5. **Mapping Genomic Positions**: Tools such as OMIM and RCSB\u2019s chromosome mapping service are used for mapping genomic coordinates to protein sequences and 3D structures.\n\n6. **PDB API and Software Licenses**: The RCSB PDB web services and APIs are recommended resources. The BioSyc software content is freely available with no license required. For other software inquiries, contacting info@rcsb.org is advised.\n\n7. **Hyperlinks for Unreleased Data**: For unpublished PDB data, DOI-style links can be provided which become active upon release. No such system currently exists for EMDB data, but URLs to EMDB entries may be used directly.\n\n8. **Permissions for Use of PDB Illustrations**: Molecular images on RCSB PDB are free for both commercial and non-commercial use with citation of the structural data authors and RCSB PDB.\n\n9. **Redirecting Deposit Questions**: Deposit-related inquiries should be addressed via the appropriate wwPDB data center help desks listed on the wwPDB contact page.\n\n10. **Depositing Old Entries Without Experimental Data**: Structures determined before mandatory deposition of experimental data may be accepted if published prior to January 1, 2008, meet sequence or ligand novelty criteria, and are reviewed by wwPDB Directors.\n\n11. **Email Whitelisting**: Guidance is provided for users whose email systems (e.g., Gmail) may filter wwPDB messages to Spam, including links to instructions on how to whitelist addresses.\n\n12. **Deposit Holds and Extensions**: Extensions of hold dates are normally granted only if the primary publication has been submitted. Otherwise, depositors are advised to withdraw and re-deposit entries to obtain a fresh one-year hold period. The re-deposition process is streamlined within the OneDep system.\n\n13. **Expired Hold Entries**: Entries held for more than one year without release or updates will be withdrawn as per wwPDB policy, with notifications sent to depositors.\n\n14. **Group Depositions**: Large numbers of related structures (e.g., 117 protein structures) can be deposited as group submissions.\n\nOverall, the text encompasses policies, example responses, and procedural advice for the management, release, and communication regarding macromolecular structure data within wwPDB systems, with emphasis on proper channels, documentation requirements, and user guidance.",

Therefore, for these examples, wwPDB will continue to provide secondary structure with helix and sheet information in the PDBx/mmCIF formatted file. Validation, calculation of bond, angle, torsion deviations, etc.The calculation of bond and angle deviations for protein entries will be based on the updated Engh &Huber amino acid target values3. For nucleic acids, the Parkinson et al., statistics are used for these calculations4. All bonds and angles that deviate more than 6 times from their standard target values will be flagged as a deviation. The PHI/PSI values are based on Kleywegt\u2019s calculations5.

              "content": "The document provides detailed guidelines for depositing molecular structures, NMR data, cryo-EM, and other macromolecular structural data via the wwPDB OneDep system and related repositories to ensure accuracy, standardization, and reproducibility.\n\nFor molecular structures and NMR data, the process involves uploading files (e.g., mmCIF, PDB, NMR-STAR, NEF), correcting errors, matching chemical components, submitting detailed polymer sequences (including unknown residues), and entering funding and precise assembly (quaternary structure) information with evidence. NMR depositions require atomic coordinates, experimental restraints, chemical shifts, peak lists, and metadata like pH and temperature. Automatic validation reports check geometry, restraints, chemical shifts, and ensembles; depositors must address errors before final submission, typically linked with journal peer review. Validation reports are provided in PDF and XML format. Policies include confidential curator reviews, mandatory acknowledgment of reports, controlled file replacement (limited coordinate updates post-release), and session expiration after three months. ORCiD login is mandatory for contact authors, with email verification for first-time users. Depositors receive deposition IDs and non-resettable passwords unless using ORCiD. Author lists can be edited during deposition; accession codes are sequentially assigned upon release. Raw data archiving with DOIs is encouraged. The wwPDB annotation process may modify chain IDs and residue numbering, which depositors should not alter. The standalone wwPDB Validation Server is distinct from OneDep and unsuitable for deposition validation but offers API access. Communication with biocurators occurs via the interface or email.\n\nFor cryo-EM data depositions, composite maps plus atomic models must be submitted, with separate but linked global consensus and focused maps. Atomic models can be fitted or derived from existing PDB structures and validated using EMRinger, MolProbity, Q-scores, and FSC metrics (requiring standardized XML submissions). Models can be updated without changing PDB IDs, but maps are immutable post-release; corrections need new depositions. Raw data should be linked via EMPIAR accessions. Only one model per EM entry is allowed, and modeling should be confined to well-defined density areas; speculative modeling is discouraged. Helical reconstructions count filament subsections as segments. Multiple additional maps can be uploaded, though validation focuses on primary map and model. Tools like pdb_extract assist in metadata and composite map deposition. EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 formats but distributes maps in CCP4 format. Structural releases linked to publications occur promptly, with delays mostly due to metadata mismatches.\n\nGeneral macromolecular structure deposition requires completing administrative fields and linking related entries when applicable. Metadata templates and tools like the RCSB PDB Group Deposition system support submitting multiple related structures with shared data. Large or symmetric structures require specific formats and auxiliary files. Differences between depositor input and validation reports in chain IDs or residue numbering require no depositor action. Required files differ by method (e.g., 3DEM demands primary maps, half-maps, and images); raw image data should be linked with DOIs. Detailed sample, ligand, processing, and refinement information must be provided. Depositor contact information, including email, country, and ORCiD, is mandatory. Rapid submission and low-traffic periods improve chances for consecutive PDB IDs. Re-refinements must reference original PDB IDs with appropriate content descriptors. Multiple experimental methods can be indicated; purely theoretical models are excluded. Missing software entries can be requested via curators. MmCIF files should ideally be produced by refinement software or pdb_extract; structure factor files can be converted with special tools. The upload system supports all necessary files per experimental method.\n\nTogether, these practices foster comprehensive, standardized, and transparent deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular data, enhancing data quality, sharing, and reuse in structural biology.",

Depositable data include atomic coordinates, experimental restraints (NOE, dihedral angles, RDCs, hydrogen bonds), chemical shifts, peak lists, and experimental metadata. While PDB archives 3D coordinates, restraints, and shifts, BMRB accepts detailed NMR data even without coordinates.\n\nThe deposition process requires uploading files in specific formats (e.g., mmCIF, PDB, NMR-STAR, NEF), providing thorough metadata (pH, temperature, solvent, labeling), reviewing an automatic NMR validation report covering structure and data quality, resolving any issues, and submitting to obtain accession codes. Validation checks include geometry, restraint violations, chemical shifts, and ensemble analysis. Common errors involve formatting and file inconsistencies, with online validation tools available prior to submission. Depositions are usually required before or during journal peer review; public release can be delayed until publication. Validation reports are provided in PDF and XML formats.\n\nAdditional policies govern submission and session management: initial uploads generate preliminary validation reports, followed by confidential wwPDB curator reviews. Depositors must download and acknowledge validation reports to proceed. Files can be replaced before accession code assignment via the \u201cRe-upload files\u201d page; large changes may require metadata resets. Post-submission replacements need curator approval, with limitations on coordinate file updates after release (one replacement per entry per year, max three entries per Principal Investigator annually). Unsubmitted sessions expire after three months.\n\nORCiD login is mandatory for all contact authors and recommended for all contributors; first-time contact authors must verify their email. Depositors receive a deposition ID and a non-resettable password unless logging in via ORCiD. Author lists can be edited during deposition. Accessions are issued sequentially without preassignment.\n\nDepositors are encouraged to archive raw experimental data in recommended repositories (e.g., ProteiDiffraction.org, EMPIAR, BMRB) and provide related DOIs during or after deposition. The wwPDB annotation process may alter chain IDs and residue numbering for uniqueness; depositors should not modify these. The standalone wwPDB Validation Server differs from OneDep and is not directly usable for deposition validation but offers API access.\n\nCommunication with wwPDB biocurators is facilitated through the deposition interface\u2019s Communication page or via deposit-help@mail.wwpdb.org.

              "content": "The Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) manages the release and curation of structural data entries with a defined protocol. Authors submit entries and typically review and approve curated data before release. If authors do not respond within three weeks after receiving the validation report and there are no issues, wwPDB considers the entry approved and releases it once the associated publication is available. Authors may withdraw unreleased entries before publication; withdrawn entries remain listed with a \"WDRN\" status and their latest processed files are preserved for possible future re-deposition.\n\nProblematic entries identified by wwPDB biocurators\u2014due to unusual chemistry, sequence mismatches, or other concerns\u2014are discussed with authors for resolution. Unresolved issues after one year lead to withdrawal unless a related publication exists, in which case the entry may be released with a caveat. Withdrawn status can be reversed if the entry is later published. Coordinate and experimental data are always released together, sharing the same release status (REL for immediate release, HPUB for Hold until Publication, or HOLD for date-specific hold). Deadlines for release requests align with weekly update cycles.\n\nUnreleased entries display limited public information such as title, authorship, status, unique PDB ID, and experimental data availability, but sensitive details may be suppressed at the author\u2019s request. PDB IDs and ligand codes are assigned automatically upon deposition completion and cannot be requested or reserved by authors. Authors may update coordinates, experimental data, and metadata any time before release. After release, minor updates (e.g., citation corrections or small format fixes) are allowed freely, while major revisions (changes to coordinates, chemical composition, or sequence) occur via formal depositor- or wwPDB-initiated updates.\n\nWeekly processing involves data integrity checks, with correspondence deadlines for authors typically at noon Thursday local time at processing sites. Released data are synchronized weekly across all wwPDB FTP sites. Access to unreleased data is restricted to authors, with limited metadata sometimes publicly available if authors permit. Journal reviewers and users cannot obtain unreleased data from wwPDB but are encouraged to request validation reports from authors during manuscript review.\n\nRelease policies specify that REL entries are released promptly after author approval, or automatically after three weeks if no response is received and no issues exist. HPUB and HOLD entries remain on hold until publication or one year from deposition, whichever is first. If not released after one year, entries must be either released or withdrawn. Ten months after deposition, wwPDB contacts authors of unreleased entries to decide release or withdrawal. Publication detection via accession codes in literature triggers automatic release of HPUB entries. The wwPDB supports open science by promoting immediate data release coinciding with publication and manages post-release revisions under a versioning system.",

If no reply is received within three weeks after the validation report is made available to the authors,the wwPDB will consider the entry to have been approved by the authors. If at that point thereare no outstanding issues2 with the entry, the entry will be released. For entries with outstandingissues see the Problem Structures section below. Entries can be released without citation information and updated with this information at a later date.HPUB/HOLD entries will be released either when release is requested by the authors or by a journal, or when the wwPDB becomes aware of a publication describing the entry.HPUB/HOLD entries cannot be held for more than one year beyond the date of deposition. If an entry remains unreleased at the end of the hold period, it must either be released or withdrawn. Ten months following deposition, the wwPDB will communicate with the authors of unreleasedentries, asking whether they wish to release or withdraw the entry before the one-year anniversary of the deposition date.The wwPDB promotes open science and immediate release of data when associated publications appear online (identified by detection of wwPDB Core Archive [PDB, EMDB,BMRB]accession codes in those publications). wwPDB policies state that if a wwPDB CoreArchive database accession code is identified in a publication (pre-print or peer-reviewed)the on Hold for Publication entry will be released. If a Depositor has questions or concerns regarding a specific entry, she/he should directly contact the leader of the appropriate wwPDB data center.

              "content": "The document provides detailed guidelines for depositing molecular structures, NMR data, cryo-EM, and other macromolecular structural data via the wwPDB OneDep system and related repositories to ensure accuracy, standardization, and reproducibility.\n\nFor molecular structures and NMR data, the process involves uploading files (e.g., mmCIF, PDB, NMR-STAR, NEF), correcting errors, matching chemical components, submitting detailed polymer sequences (including unknown residues), and entering funding and precise assembly (quaternary structure) information with evidence. NMR depositions require atomic coordinates, experimental restraints, chemical shifts, peak lists, and metadata like pH and temperature. Automatic validation reports check geometry, restraints, chemical shifts, and ensembles; depositors must address errors before final submission, typically linked with journal peer review. Validation reports are provided in PDF and XML format. Policies include confidential curator reviews, mandatory acknowledgment of reports, controlled file replacement (limited coordinate updates post-release), and session expiration after three months. ORCiD login is mandatory for contact authors, with email verification for first-time users. Depositors receive deposition IDs and non-resettable passwords unless using ORCiD. Author lists can be edited during deposition; accession codes are sequentially assigned upon release. Raw data archiving with DOIs is encouraged. The wwPDB annotation process may modify chain IDs and residue numbering, which depositors should not alter. The standalone wwPDB Validation Server is distinct from OneDep and unsuitable for deposition validation but offers API access. Communication with biocurators occurs via the interface or email.\n\nFor cryo-EM data depositions, composite maps plus atomic models must be submitted, with separate but linked global consensus and focused maps. Atomic models can be fitted or derived from existing PDB structures and validated using EMRinger, MolProbity, Q-scores, and FSC metrics (requiring standardized XML submissions). Models can be updated without changing PDB IDs, but maps are immutable post-release; corrections need new depositions. Raw data should be linked via EMPIAR accessions. Only one model per EM entry is allowed, and modeling should be confined to well-defined density areas; speculative modeling is discouraged. Helical reconstructions count filament subsections as segments. Multiple additional maps can be uploaded, though validation focuses on primary map and model. Tools like pdb_extract assist in metadata and composite map deposition. EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 formats but distributes maps in CCP4 format. Structural releases linked to publications occur promptly, with delays mostly due to metadata mismatches.\n\nGeneral macromolecular structure deposition requires completing administrative fields and linking related entries when applicable. Metadata templates and tools like the RCSB PDB Group Deposition system support submitting multiple related structures with shared data. Large or symmetric structures require specific formats and auxiliary files. Differences between depositor input and validation reports in chain IDs or residue numbering require no depositor action. Required files differ by method (e.g., 3DEM demands primary maps, half-maps, and images); raw image data should be linked with DOIs. Detailed sample, ligand, processing, and refinement information must be provided. Depositor contact information, including email, country, and ORCiD, is mandatory. Rapid submission and low-traffic periods improve chances for consecutive PDB IDs. Re-refinements must reference original PDB IDs with appropriate content descriptors. Multiple experimental methods can be indicated; purely theoretical models are excluded. Missing software entries can be requested via curators. MmCIF files should ideally be produced by refinement software or pdb_extract; structure factor files can be converted with special tools. The upload system supports all necessary files per experimental method.\n\nTogether, these practices foster comprehensive, standardized, and transparent deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular data, enhancing data quality, sharing, and reuse in structural biology.",

First-time contact authors must verify their email address.  \n- After logging in, users see a summary table of entries linked to their ORCiD and can start new depositions. Selecting your country redirects you to the appropriate wwPDB member deposition site.  \n- Depositors receive a deposition ID and a randomly generated password via email. Passwords currently cannot be reset or changed, so ORCiD login is recommended to avoid sharing personal passwords.  \n- Authors can be added, reordered, or removed from entries via the interface.  \n\n**Session Management:**  \n- Unsubmitted deposition sessions are saved for 3 months from the last login; afterward, the session and uploaded files are deleted with no access.  \n- Depositions for structure prediction competitions can be designated by selecting the \"Prediction Target\" option with the relevant initiative (e.g., CASP).  \n- Consecutive PDB accession numbers are not reserved or preassigned; they are issued based on submission time.  \n\n**ORCiD Requirements:**  \n- An ORCiD is mandatory for all contact authors before deposition. Registration is free and quick at www.orcid.org.  \n- While not required for all structure authors, providing ORCiDs is encouraged to distinguish individuals and assist journal manuscript submissions.  \n\n**Raw Data Deposition:**  \n- Depositors are strongly encouraged to archive raw data in curated repositories and provide corresponding DOIs in the \u201cRelated Entries\u201d section. Recommended archives include ProteiDiffraction.org, SBGrid, CXIDB, XRDa for X-ray data; EMPIAR for electron microscopy; and BMRB for NMR data.  \n- Raw image DOIs can be provided after deposition through communication with wwPDB.  \n\n**Access and Password Issues:**  \n- Depositors must use the deposition ID (starting with D_) and correct password to log in.  \n- Passwords can be retrieved via the \"Forgot Password\" link by submitting deposition ID and registered email; only registered emails at the time of deposition will receive password resets.  \n- Alternatively, ORCiD login bypasses the need for session passwords.  \n- Common reasons for not receiving password emails include incorrect email/ID, email not associated with the deposition, or emails filtered to spam.  \n\n**Replacing Data:**  \n- Authors can update coordinate files for released entries while retaining original PDB accession codes to preserve publication links.  \n- Updates are submitted via the OeDep communication panel or legacy email system.  \n- Only coordinate file changes are allowed; experimental data cannot be changed.  \n- Versioning is limited to one replacement per entry per year and three entries per Principal Investigator per year.  \n\n**Communication & Support:**  \n- Depositors can contact wwPDB biocuration staff via the Communication page within the deposition interface for specific entries.  \n- General feedback can be sent to deposit-help@mail.wwpdb.org if not tied to a specific deposition.  \n\nThis summary reflects the key points and numeric details from the provided sections related to deposition sessions, author management, ORCiD use, raw data submission, password retrieval, data replacement rules, and communication avenues.",

These requirements include: three-dimensional atomic coordinates, information about the composition of the structure (studied sample sequence(s), source organism(s), molecule name(s), chemistry, etc.), information about the experiment performed, details of the structure determination steps and author contact information are also necessary for the deposition. In addition, structure factor or intensity data are required for X-ray submissions, restraints and chemical shifts are required for NMR submissions. Map volumedeposition to EMDB is mandatory for PDB depositions of 3DEM models. If the experimental data deposited with the model coordinates does not follow traditional processing procedures then raw data should be made available by providing a DOI assigned by the existing archives for raw experimental data (eg SBGrid or IRRMC).Mandatory X-ray structure factor data and NMR restraint data deposition started from Feb 1st, 2008. Mandatory NMR chemical shift data deposition started from Dec 6th, 2020. MandatoryEM map volume deposition started from Sep 5th, 2016.For structures determined by X-ray crystallography, all atoms must have full B factors. If TLS was used during refinement, the residual B factors must be converted to full B factors. All atoms described by TLS records must have associated ANISOU records.",

Entry Authors, designated by the PI/Team Leader, must approve data before submission. Since September 24, 2021, principal investigators\u2019 names, emails, and ORCiD IDs are publicly released. Citation Authors listed on primary publications may differ from Entry Authors. Re-refined entries require citing original data and are released only post-publication.

Authors submit entries and typically review and approve curated data before release. If authors do not respond within three weeks after receiving the validation report and there are no issues, wwPDB considers the entry approved and releases it once the associated publication is available. Authors may withdraw unreleased entries before publication; withdrawn entries remain listed with a \"WDRN\" status and their latest processed files are preserved for possible future re-deposition.\n\nProblematic entries identified by wwPDB biocurators\u2014due to unusual chemistry, sequence mismatches, or other concerns\u2014are discussed with authors for resolution. Unresolved issues after one year lead to withdrawal unless a related publication exists, in which case the entry may be released with a caveat. Withdrawn status can be reversed if the entry is later published. Coordinate and experimental data are always released together, sharing the same release status (REL for immediate release, HPUB for Hold until Publication, or HOLD for date-specific hold). Deadlines for release requests align with weekly update cycles.\n\nUnreleased entries display limited public information such as title, authorship, status, unique PDB ID, and experimental data availability, but sensitive details may be suppressed at the author\u2019s request. PDB IDs and ligand codes are assigned automatically upon deposition completion and cannot be requested or reserved by authors. Authors may update coordinates, experimental data, and metadata any time before release. After release, minor updates (e.g., citation corrections or small format fixes) are allowed freely, while major revisions (changes to coordinates, chemical composition, or sequence) occur via formal depositor- or wwPDB-initiated updates.\n\nWeekly processing involves data integrity checks, with correspondence deadlines for authors typically at noon Thursday local time at processing sites. Released data are synchronized weekly across all wwPDB FTP sites. Access to unreleased data is restricted to authors, with limited metadata sometimes publicly available if authors permit. Journal reviewers and users cannot obtain unreleased data from wwPDB but are encouraged to request validation reports from authors during manuscript review.\n\nRelease policies specify that REL entries are released promptly after author approval, or automatically after three weeks if no response is received and no issues exist. HPUB and HOLD entries remain on hold until publication or one year from deposition, whichever is first. If not released after one year, entries must be either released or withdrawn. Ten months after deposition, wwPDB contacts authors of unreleased entries to decide release or withdrawal. Publication detection via accession codes in literature triggers automatic release of HPUB entries. The wwPDB supports open science by promoting immediate data release coinciding with publication and manages post-release revisions under a versioning system.",

If an entry remains unreleased at the end of the hold period, it must either be released or withdrawn. Ten months following deposition, the wwPDB will communicate with the authors of unreleasedentries, asking whether they wish to release or withdraw the entry before the one-year anniversary of the deposition date.The wwPDB promotes open science and immediate release of data when associated publications appear online (identified by detection of wwPDB Core Archive [PDB, EMDB,BMRB]accession codes in those publications). wwPDB policies state that if a wwPDB CoreArchive database accession code is identified in a publication (pre-print or peer-reviewed)the on Hold for Publication entry will be released. If a Depositor has questions or concerns regarding a specific entry, she/he should directly contact the leader of the appropriate wwPDB data center.

PDB IDs and ligand codes are assigned automatically upon deposition completion and cannot be requested or reserved by authors. Authors may update coordinates, experimental data, and metadata any time before release. After release, minor updates (e.g., citation corrections or small format fixes) are allowed freely, while major revisions (changes to coordinates, chemical composition, or sequence) occur via formal depositor- or wwPDB-initiated updates.\n\nWeekly processing involves data integrity checks, with correspondence deadlines for authors typically at noon Thursday local time at processing sites. Released data are synchronized weekly across all wwPDB FTP sites. Access to unreleased data is restricted to authors, with limited metadata sometimes publicly available if authors permit. Journal reviewers and users cannot obtain unreleased data from wwPDB but are encouraged to request validation reports from authors during manuscript review.\n\nRelease policies specify that REL entries are released promptly after author approval, or automatically after three weeks if no response is received and no issues exist. HPUB and HOLD entries remain on hold until publication or one year from deposition, whichever is first. If not released after one year, entries must be either released or withdrawn. Ten months after deposition, wwPDB contacts authors of unreleased entries to decide release or withdrawal. Publication detection via accession codes in literature triggers automatic release of HPUB entries. The wwPDB supports open science by promoting immediate data release coinciding with publication and manages post-release revisions under a versioning system.",

While every effort to track citations and release entries is made in atimely manner, it is ultimately the responsibility of the authors to notify wwPDB when publication occurs.Authors may withdraw their unreleased entries, provided the publication citing the entry has not been published. Withdrawnentries will remain in the list of unreleased entries in the EMDB archive (status WDRN).An entry for which these issues cannot be resolved will be withdrawn upon expiration of the one-year hold unless a publicationdescribing the entry is available. In that case, the entry willbe released by wwPDB staff.In addition to the above instructions provided at the time of deposition, there are two further instructions regarding release(Withdrawn and Obsolete) that can be assigned to an entry.Withdrawn (WDRN). An EMDB entry can only be withdrawn ifit has not been released. Withdrawn entries have no data and metadata in the public EMDB archive. The assigned EMDB code will not be re-used.Obsolete (OBs). An EMDB entry can be made obsolete if its data or metadata is already in the public archive. Any updates to aprimary map will require obsoleting the current EMDB entry and depositing a new one. Upon obsoletion, the entry is moved to aseparate area in the public EMDB archive and thus remains publicly accessible. 5.4.3 Entry statusThe EMDB entry status describes the current state of an entry that is assigned within OneDep. The following status codes are possible:(*) EM maps derived from data generated by other research groups (e.g., from data made publicly accessible in the EMPIARarchive) may be deposited, but will not be processed or released until an associated peer-reviewed publication becomesavailable. The same policy applies if an existing EMDB entry generated by another research group is used to produce a newmodel deposition. A model derived from an existing EMDB entry and generated by authors other than those of the entry, canreference the original EM map only if an associated peer-reviewed publication for the model is available. The model wil then be referenced in the EMDB entry.5.4.4 Release processReleasing an entry involves making the data and/or metadata available in the public EMDB archive.The release processincludes the following steps:\u00b7After successful processing, a notification requesting final review of the entry is sent to the contact author(s).

Author personal data remain private apart from publicly shown last names, initials, and citation authorship.\n\nwwPDB staff biocurate entries by checking metadata-data consistency, visually inspecting data quality, and ensuring map-model agreement. Communication with authors resolves issues; unresolved cases receive WAIT status or are escalated. After curation, authors have three weeks to review, with silence implying approval.\n\nOfficial wwPDB EM validation reports follow biocuration, aiding manuscript submissions.\n\nEntry statuses indicate progress, including AUTH (awaiting approval), HOLD (held up to one year), HPUB (held until publication or one year), REL (released), OBS (obsolete), WDRN (withdrawn pre-release), among others.\n\nReleasing an entry requires meeting all deposition, biocuration, validation, metadata, and PDB policy criteria. Authors select release instructions during deposition: Immediate Release (REL), Hold Until Publication (HPUB), or Hold (HOLD). Entries on hold must release or withdraw within one year; authors are contacted at ten months. Entries citing publications cannot be withdrawn and will be released. Weekly public releases occur Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC, with release requests deadlines Thursdays at noon local time.\n\nModifications before release are possible via wwPDB communication; after release, primary maps cannot be altered and require obsoletion and new entries for updates. Minor metadata/file changes after release must be justified.\n\nRemoval options include obsoletion (OBS) for released entries\u2014moved to an archived but public section with new accession codes required for replacements\u2014and withdrawal (WDRN) for unpublished entries, which are removed from public access and never reassigned codes. Withdrawal is not allowed once a primary citation is known. Exceptional circumstances like retractions may prompt obsoletion with author communication.\n\nOverall, these processes ensure EMDB entries are accurate, properly documented, timely released in line with publications, and maintain data integrity and public accessibility.",

Modification of entries6.1 Entry changes before releaseBefore public release, most issues can be resolved by communicating with wwPDB staf.After sumission of an EMDB entry,thedeposition is locked for further modifications and changes. Additional data or information may be required, in which case thedeposition may be temporarily unlocked by wwPDB staff. This option is used sparingly to avoid creating inconsistencies in themetadata.6.2 Entry changes after releaseIn some cases, it may be necessary to modify an entry after release. This may apply to both the data and the metadata (e.g..update of the primary citation details). However, the primary map of an EMDB entry cannot be changed after release. Instead,the entry would need to be made bsolete and then replaced by an entrely new deposition. Occasionally, additional data filesmay need to be added or unintentionally uploaded files may need to be removed. Such changes should be discussed withwwPDB staff and should be justied by the contact author(s). Depending on the nature of the changes, it may take some time for them to be reflected in the public archive.7. Removal of entries7.1 Entry obsoletionAn EMDB entry can only be made obsolete after it has been released. Obsoleting an entry changes the status code of thedeposition to OBS and moves its files out of the active part of the public archive into a separate area of the archive where theEMDB entry willstillbe publily accessible. Entry obsoletion can be requested, and should be justified, by the contact author(s).Once acted upon, an email confirming the obsoletion is sent to the contact author(s).

Unreleased entries at the PDB archive contain the title, authorship, status, PDB ID,experimental data status and sequence availability. Entry titles and authorship may be suppressed at the request of the Contact Author, but status and PDB ID cannot be publiclysuppressed.4 Assignment of PDB IDs and Ligand codes Can a PDB ID or ligand code be requested?Neither a single PDB ID/ligand code nor a range of PDB IDs/ligand codes may be requested.The wwPDB reserves the right to change author\u2019s ligand codes. PDB ID and ligand codes areautomatically assigned and do not carry identifying information.When are PDB IDs assigned?PDB IDs are automatically assigned by the deposition software tool, when the author has completed his/her deposition (i.e., the author has filled out at least the minimal information for deposition and has pressed the deposit &confirmation buttons.)5 Changes to Entries What changes can be made before release? Authors can update the coordinates, experimental data, and related header information any time before release.If the depositor sends new coordinates for an entry shortly before or at the time of electronic orpaper publication, the release of the entry may be subject to delay because the file must be re-processed.Once an entry is marked for release, the author has until the deadline time listed above (seeSection 3, Deadline for requesting release of entries)to submit revisions or to request the entrynot to be released.What changes can be made after release?Minor changes may be made. These are defined as:\u2022Update on metadata section such as citation, author\u2019s name, etc.\u2022Update or change on structure factor or constraint file due to format corrections or additionof data set while coordinates remain unchanged. Major revisions to coordinates that change the structure's geometry or chemical composition(such as a change in the sequence of the polymers or ligand identity)can be made through depositor-initiated or wwPDB-initiated updates. Major revisions include:\u2022Replacement of any existing coordinates (the x,y,z values themselves).\u2022Changes in chemical composition (e.g., SO4\u2192PO4 or SER\u2192CYS).\u2022Changes in coordinate section including chain ID, numbering, atom name, ordering of molecules and/or ligands.Changes in sample sequence including add or remove a region that is unobserved in the coordinates such as terminal or loop region.",

              "content": "The document outlines the deposition, biocuration, validation, release, modification, and removal processes for EMDB (Electron Microscopy Data Bank) entries, emphasizing data integrity, author responsibility, and access policies.\n\n**Deposition and Accession Codes:**  \n- Depositors receive a unique 10-digit deposition code (starting with \"D_\") for internal use during the OneDep system session.  \n- Upon submission, an EMDB accession code (format \"EMD-\" followed by at least four digits) is issued for public referencing. These accession codes increase incrementally and remain unchanged once assigned.\n\n**Deposition Process:**  \n- Data (maps converted to standard CCP4 format) and metadata are submitted via OneDep and validated by the system with wwPDB staff support as needed.  \n- Contact and author personal data (names, email, ORCID, etc.) are collected but kept private except last names, initials, and citation authors which are public.\n\n**Biocuration Process:**  \n- wwPDB staff check for discrepancies between metadata and data (e.g., resolution mismatches) and visually inspect EM data quality, ensuring map and model coordinate consistency.  \n- Issues found are communicated to contact authors; unresolved issues lead to a status of WAIT or referral to wwPDB PIs.  \n- Following curation, entries undergo author review with a three-week response period assumed as approval if no communication occurs.\n\n**Validation:**  \n- Official wwPDB EM validation reports are generated post-biocuration to assess map and model quality and are recommended for use during manuscript submission and review.\n\n**Entry Status Codes:**  \n- Status codes convey the current state, including:  \n  - AUTH (annotated, awaiting approval)  \n  - HOLD (on hold for up to one year)  \n  - HPUB (on hold until publication or one year)  \n  - OBS (obsolete)  \n  - POLC (awaiting policy decision)  \n  - PROC (being processed)  \n  - REFI (awaiting publication for maps derived from archived data by other groups)  \n  - REL (released)  \n  - REPL (replaced primary map, not processed)  \n  - WAIT (awaiting more info)  \n  - WDRN (withdrawn pre-release)\n\n**Release Requirements and Instructions:**  \n- Release requires fulfillment of deposition requirements, completion of biocuration and validation, metadata consistency, and PDB policy adherence for associated atomic models.  \n- Release instructions, chosen during deposition, include:  \n  - Immediate Release (REL) \u2014 released once approved.  \n  - Hold Until Publication (HPUB) \u2014 held up to one year or until publication.  \n  - Hold (HOLD) \u2014 held up to one year.  \n- Entries on hold must be released or withdrawn by one year post-deposition. Authors are contacted ten months after deposition to confirm intentions.  \n- Entries citing publications cannot be withdrawn and will be released by wwPDB.  \n- EMDB conducts weekly public releases on Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC, with deadlines for release requests at noon Thursdays (local time).\n\n**Modification of Entries:**  \n- Before release, most issues can be addressed via communication with wwPDB; depositions are locked post-submission but may be temporarily unlocked sparingly.  \n- After release, primary maps cannot be changed; obsoletion with superseding new entries is required for updates. Minor metadata or additional file changes must be justified and coordinated with wwPDB.\n\n**Entry Removal:**  \n- Obsoletion (OBS) applies to released entries moved to a separate archive section but remains publicly accessible; superseding requires a new EMDB accession code.  \n- Withdrawal (WDRN) applies only to unreleased entries with no public data; withdrawn codes are never reused, and entries appear on an unreleased list.  \n- Entries cannot be withdrawn once a primary citation is known to wwPDB.  \n- Unusual circumstances (e.g., publication retractions or investigative findings) may prompt obsoletion requests, with efforts made to communicate with authors.\n\nOverall, the process ensures EMDB entries\u2019 quality, proper documentation, timely release aligned with publication, and maintenance of data integrity and public accessibility.",

Any issues that prevent successful processing of the EMDB entry wilead to a change of the status code to WAIT (see 5.4.2). If an issue cannotbe resolved between wwPDB annotation staff and the contact authors), the matte will be referred to the wwPDB Pls for adecision.When biocuration is complete,the EMDB entry is sent to the contact author(s) for final review and approval.If no communicationis received within three weeks, it is assumed that the entry is approved.Any issues willbe resolved through communication withwwPDB staff. Entries where isues are identified by the wwPDB biocuration staff or from the contents of the wwPDB validationreport, will be discussed with the authors in order to resolve them. An entry for which these issues cannot be resolved will bewithdrawn upon expiration of the one-year hold unless a publication describing the entry is available In that case, the entry willbe released with a caveat record. Ifa publication describing a recently withdrawn entry appears in the literature,the withdrawnstatus of an entry may be reversed by wwPDB. 5.3 Validation processEM validation reports are generated to provide quality assessment of EM maps and any PDB atomic models within a deposition.Itis highly recommended that the offcial validation report generated after biocuration is provided to journal editors and refereesas part of the manuscript submission and review process. The reports are date-stamped and display the wwPDB logo. For more information see the wwPDB Validation Reports home page.5.4 ReleaseThe release of an entry depends upon the fulilment of the release requirements, the release instruction provided and thecurrent status of an enty. These three aspects of the release willbe described in further detail followed by an outline of therelease process. 5.4.1 Release requirements An EMDB entry can progress to the release phase within OneDep under the following conditions:",

Given the complex nature of some of the issues that can arise during processing, exceptions to policy are considered on a case-by-case basis by the wwPDB Directors/Heads.The two sections in the complete document are: A: wwPDB policies B: wwPDB processing procedures Further information about these sections is available in the introduction to each section.Sept. 2021: major version 5.0, make contact info for entry PI(s)public.1 PDB Entry RequirementsWhat are the requirements of acceptance of an entry to the PDB?OneDep depositions The wwPDB will accept all experimentally determined structures of biological macromoleculesthat meet the minimum requirements. These requirements include: three-dimensional atomic coordinates, information about the composition of the structure (studied sample sequence(s), source organism(s), molecule name(s), chemistry, etc.), information about the experiment performed, details of the structure determination steps and author contact information are also necessary for the deposition. In addition, structure factor or intensity data are required for X-ray submissions, restraints and chemical shifts are required for NMR submissions. Map volumedeposition to EMDB is mandatory for PDB depositions of 3DEM models. If the experimental data deposited with the model coordinates does not follow traditional processing procedures then raw data should be made available by providing a DOI assigned by the existing archives for raw experimental data (eg SBGrid or IRRMC).Mandatory X-ray structure factor data and NMR restraint data deposition started from Feb 1st, 2008. Mandatory NMR chemical shift data deposition started from Dec 6th, 2020. MandatoryEM map volume deposition started from Sep 5th, 2016.For structures determined by X-ray crystallography, all atoms must have full B factors. If TLS was used during refinement, the residual B factors must be converted to full B factors. All atoms described by TLS records must have associated ANISOU records.",

If no reply is received within three weeks after the validation report is made available to the authors,the wwPDB will consider the entry to have been approved by the authors. If at that point thereare no outstanding issues2 with the entry, the entry will be released. For entries with outstandingissues see the Problem Structures section below. Entries can be released without citation information and updated with this information at a later date.HPUB/HOLD entries will be released either when release is requested by the authors or by a journal, or when the wwPDB becomes aware of a publication describing the entry.HPUB/HOLD entries cannot be held for more than one year beyond the date of deposition. If an entry remains unreleased at the end of the hold period, it must either be released or withdrawn. Ten months following deposition, the wwPDB will communicate with the authors of unreleasedentries, asking whether they wish to release or withdraw the entry before the one-year anniversary of the deposition date.The wwPDB promotes open science and immediate release of data when associated publications appear online (identified by detection of wwPDB Core Archive [PDB, EMDB,BMRB]accession codes in those publications). wwPDB policies state that if a wwPDB CoreArchive database accession code is identified in a publication (pre-print or peer-reviewed)the on Hold for Publication entry will be released. If a Depositor has questions or concerns regarding a specific entry, she/he should directly contact the leader of the appropriate wwPDB data center. Any revision of the PDB entry following release will be managed under the PDB 2 Note: Any issues that arise during annotation that prevent the standard processing of submissions are considered to be outstanding issues.

Therefore, for these examples, wwPDB will continue to provide secondary structure with helix and sheet information in the PDBx/mmCIF formatted file. Validation, calculation of bond, angle, torsion deviations, etc.The calculation of bond and angle deviations for protein entries will be based on the updated Engh &Huber amino acid target values3. For nucleic acids, the Parkinson et al., statistics are used for these calculations4. All bonds and angles that deviate more than 6 times from their standard target values will be flagged as a deviation. The PHI/PSI values are based on Kleywegt\u2019s calculations5. The deviations are reported in mmcif categories below, and REMARK 500 of PDB format file.

Unreleased entries at the PDB archive contain the title, authorship, status, PDB ID,experimental data status and sequence availability. Entry titles and authorship may be suppressed at the request of the Contact Author, but status and PDB ID cannot be publiclysuppressed.4 Assignment of PDB IDs and Ligand codes Can a PDB ID or ligand code be requested?Neither a single PDB ID/ligand code nor a range of PDB IDs/ligand codes may be requested.The wwPDB reserves the right to change author\u2019s ligand codes. PDB ID and ligand codes areautomatically assigned and do not carry identifying information.When are PDB IDs assigned?PDB IDs are automatically assigned by the deposition software tool, when the author has completed his/her deposition (i.e., the author has filled out at least the minimal information for deposition and has pressed the deposit &confirmation buttons.)5 Changes to Entries What changes can be made before release? Authors can update the coordinates, experimental data, and related header information any time before release.If the depositor sends new coordinates for an entry shortly before or at the time of electronic orpaper publication, the release of the entry may be subject to delay because the file must be re-processed.Once an entry is marked for release, the author has until the deadline time listed above (seeSection 3, Deadline for requesting release of entries)to submit revisions or to request the entrynot to be released.What changes can be made after release?Minor changes may be made. These are defined as:\u2022Update on metadata section such as citation, author\u2019s name, etc.\u2022Update or change on structure factor or constraint file due to format corrections or additionof data set while coordinates remain unchanged. Major revisions to coordinates that change the structure's geometry or chemical composition(such as a change in the sequence of the polymers or ligand identity)can be made through depositor-initiated or wwPDB-initiated updates. Major revisions include:\u2022Replacement of any existing coordinates (the x,y,z values themselves).\u2022Changes in chemical composition (e.g., SO4\u2192PO4 or SER\u2192CYS).\u2022Changes in coordinate section including chain ID, numbering, atom name, ordering of molecules and/or ligands.Changes in sample sequence including add or remove a region that is unobserved in the coordinates such as terminal or loop region.",

Key points include:\n\n1. **Entry Metadata and Citation**: Entry titles must be clear and may be edited by wwPDB staff; author lists are decided by principal investigators and can differ from publication authors. Primary citations include PubMed and DOI identifiers when available, and unpublished or patented structures are annotated accordingly. Author names follow standard abbreviations and title capitalization.\n\n2. **Macromolecule Naming and Function**: Protein names are standardized primarily using UniProt data, with specific rules for precursors, fragments, chimeras, and antibodies. Protein functional categorization uses enzyme commission (E.C.) numbers when available and a wide range of functional keywords. When functions are unknown, generic designations like \u201cUNKNOWN FUNCTION\u201d or \u201cputative\u201d enzyme classes are applied.\n\n3. **Structure Files and Formats**: Large structures exceeding 99,999 ATOM lines are stored as single PDBx/mmCIF files with additional minimal PDB format TAR files for compatibility; these have a compatibility flag set to \"N\". Complex beta-sheet topologies not representable in PDB format are supported in PDBx/mmCIF format only.\n\n4. **Biological Assemblies and Quaternary Structure**: Assemblies combine author input and software analyses (e.g., PISA), differentiating biological from crystal packing assemblies. Details on assembly transformations, interfaces, and energetics are annotated. Oligomeric states are named with Greek/Latin numeric prefixes for 1\u201320 subunits and numerically beyond, counting polypeptides \u22653 amino acids or nucleic acids \u22652 nucleotides as subunits.\n\n5. **Electron Microscopy Data**: EM structures (single particle, helical, tomography, subtomogram averaging) and electron crystallography (EC) are supported with associated 3D volume maps, atomic coordinates, and structure factors (for EC). Atomic coordinate deposition requires prior or simultaneous release of the corresponding EM map, identified by EMDB IDs.\n\n6. **Complex Assemblies and Symmetry**: Viral capsids and other complex assemblies utilize non-crystallographic symmetry transformations (e.g., 60 matrices for icosahedral viruses). Assemblies are aligned to standard frames and documented with symmetry metadata covering point and helical symmetries.\n\n7. **Validation and Annotation**: Validation includes updated target values for bond lengths and angles (Engh & Huber for proteins, Parkinson et al. for nucleic acids). Deviations >6\u00d7 standard are flagged. Metrics cover contacts, torsions, peptide isomerizations, planarity, and chirality, recorded in mmCIF categories and REMARK 500. Covalent bonds, metal coordination, and disulfide links are annotated using standard cutoff distances and detailed atom/residue records.\n\n8. **Polymer and Sequence Standards**: Polymer sequences require minimum lengths (\u22653 amino acids with two consecutive peptide bonds for proteins; \u22652 nucleotides for nucleic acids). Carbohydrate residues are ordered from reducing to non-reducing ends per IUPAC/IUBMB rules, defining main chains in branched structures. Fragment domains within proteins are annotated.\n\n9. **Source Organism and Expression Systems**: Organism origins use scientific names and taxonomy IDs predominantly from NCBI, with UniProt references. Metadata include gene source, host organism, cell line, tissue, and subcellular location. Expression systems span bacterial (*E. coli*, taxid 562), mouse (10090), human (9606), synthetic sources, phage display, cell-free methods, and baculovirus systems, each with specific annotation requirements.\n\n10. **Mutation and Versioning**: Engineered mutations are precisely annotated using standard notation (e.g., Y20K) and correctly tagged. Entries carry version identifiers (major-minor) with the initial Structure of Record as 1-0; major versions reflect significant coordinate or sequence updates, minor versions cover other revisions; all versions are retained with latest minors.\n\n11. **Historical Updates and Data Re-refinement**: The document tracks major procedural changes since 1999, including chain ID standards updated in 2023\u20132025 and biological assembly annotation revisions since 2018. Entries re-refining prior data include explicit REMARK 0 citations referencing original entries and publications.\n\n12. **Additional Annotations and Data Management**: Functional details, ligand info, related entries, and reuse of experimental data are documented in designated metadata categories and remarks. Some site records (_struct_site and _struct_site_gen) ceased generation for new entries after June 2021. Audit categories log detailed revision histories and providers.\n\nOverall, the guidelines ensure rigorous, standardized, and transparent annotation and archival of biomolecular structural data, facilitating data consistency, interoperability, and clear linkage between coordinate models and supporting experimental evidence across the wwPDB consortium.",

Obsoleted entries include a citation to the retraction and remain publicly accessible; users searching for obsolete entries are redirected to superseding entries if available. The wwPDB regularly reviews and remediates the archive for consistency, updating metadata and nomenclature without altering coordinate data, assigning version numbers to files, and maintaining older versions on their FTP site.\n\nContact Authors, including the PI or Team Leader equivalent, must be correctly designated by the depositor and are notified of any changes or obsoletions. In conflicts, the PI/Team Leader has final decision authority. Entry Authors include the PI/Team Leader and all contributors to the structural determination as designated by the PI/Team Leader, and they must approve the final data before submission. For entries deposited or revised after September 24, 2021, principal investigators\u2019 names, emails, and ORCiD IDs are publicly available upon release.\n\nCitation Authors appear on the primary publication and may differ from Entry Authors. For re-refined entries, the original data and entry must be cited; such entries can be deposited before publication but won\u2019t be released until the publication is public. Updates to coordinates retain the same PDB ID and are versioned; however, changes to experimental data require new depositions with new PDB IDs, and the old entries are obsoleted but remain accessible. Released structures cannot be withdrawn. When entries are obsoleted without superseding replacements, a reason must be clearly stated in the entry metadata.",

Modification of entries6.1 Entry changes before releaseBefore public release, most issues can be resolved by communicating with wwPDB staf.After sumission of an EMDB entry,thedeposition is locked for further modifications and changes. Additional data or information may be required, in which case thedeposition may be temporarily unlocked by wwPDB staff. This option is used sparingly to avoid creating inconsistencies in themetadata.6.2 Entry changes after releaseIn some cases, it may be necessary to modify an entry after release. This may apply to both the data and the metadata (e.g..update of the primary citation details). However, the primary map of an EMDB entry cannot be changed after release. Instead,the entry would need to be made bsolete and then replaced by an entrely new deposition. Occasionally, additional data filesmay need to be added or unintentionally uploaded files may need to be removed. Such changes should be discussed withwwPDB staff and should be justied by the contact author(s). Depending on the nature of the changes, it may take some time for them to be reflected in the public archive.7. Removal of entries7.1 Entry obsoletionAn EMDB entry can only be made obsolete after it has been released. Obsoleting an entry changes the status code of thedeposition to OBS and moves its files out of the active part of the public archive into a separate area of the archive where theEMDB entry willstillbe publily accessible. Entry obsoletion can be requested, and should be justified, by the contact author(s).Once acted upon, an email confirming the obsoletion is sent to the contact author(s). Obsoletion can be followed by",

              "content": "The document provides detailed guidelines for depositing molecular structures, NMR data, cryo-EM, and other macromolecular structural data via the wwPDB OneDep system and related repositories to ensure accuracy, standardization, and reproducibility.\n\nFor molecular structures and NMR data, the process involves uploading files (e.g., mmCIF, PDB, NMR-STAR, NEF), correcting errors, matching chemical components, submitting detailed polymer sequences (including unknown residues), and entering funding and precise assembly (quaternary structure) information with evidence. NMR depositions require atomic coordinates, experimental restraints, chemical shifts, peak lists, and metadata like pH and temperature. Automatic validation reports check geometry, restraints, chemical shifts, and ensembles; depositors must address errors before final submission, typically linked with journal peer review. Validation reports are provided in PDF and XML format. Policies include confidential curator reviews, mandatory acknowledgment of reports, controlled file replacement (limited coordinate updates post-release), and session expiration after three months. ORCiD login is mandatory for contact authors, with email verification for first-time users. Depositors receive deposition IDs and non-resettable passwords unless using ORCiD. Author lists can be edited during deposition; accession codes are sequentially assigned upon release. Raw data archiving with DOIs is encouraged. The wwPDB annotation process may modify chain IDs and residue numbering, which depositors should not alter. The standalone wwPDB Validation Server is distinct from OneDep and unsuitable for deposition validation but offers API access. Communication with biocurators occurs via the interface or email.\n\nFor cryo-EM data depositions, composite maps plus atomic models must be submitted, with separate but linked global consensus and focused maps. Atomic models can be fitted or derived from existing PDB structures and validated using EMRinger, MolProbity, Q-scores, and FSC metrics (requiring standardized XML submissions). Models can be updated without changing PDB IDs, but maps are immutable post-release; corrections need new depositions. Raw data should be linked via EMPIAR accessions. Only one model per EM entry is allowed, and modeling should be confined to well-defined density areas; speculative modeling is discouraged. Helical reconstructions count filament subsections as segments. Multiple additional maps can be uploaded, though validation focuses on primary map and model. Tools like pdb_extract assist in metadata and composite map deposition. EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 formats but distributes maps in CCP4 format. Structural releases linked to publications occur promptly, with delays mostly due to metadata mismatches.\n\nGeneral macromolecular structure deposition requires completing administrative fields and linking related entries when applicable. Metadata templates and tools like the RCSB PDB Group Deposition system support submitting multiple related structures with shared data. Large or symmetric structures require specific formats and auxiliary files. Differences between depositor input and validation reports in chain IDs or residue numbering require no depositor action. Required files differ by method (e.g., 3DEM demands primary maps, half-maps, and images); raw image data should be linked with DOIs. Detailed sample, ligand, processing, and refinement information must be provided. Depositor contact information, including email, country, and ORCiD, is mandatory. Rapid submission and low-traffic periods improve chances for consecutive PDB IDs. Re-refinements must reference original PDB IDs with appropriate content descriptors. Multiple experimental methods can be indicated; purely theoretical models are excluded. Missing software entries can be requested via curators. MmCIF files should ideally be produced by refinement software or pdb_extract; structure factor files can be converted with special tools. The upload system supports all necessary files per experimental method.\n\nTogether, these practices foster comprehensive, standardized, and transparent deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular data, enhancing data quality, sharing, and reuse in structural biology.",

              "content": "The document provides detailed instructions and policies related to using the wwPDB OeDep system for depositing structural biology data.\n\n**Starting a Deposition Session:**  \n- Depositors are encouraged to log in using their ORCiD credentials for secure and convenient access. First-time contact authors must verify their email address.  \n- After logging in, users see a summary table of entries linked to their ORCiD and can start new depositions. Selecting your country redirects you to the appropriate wwPDB member deposition site.  \n- Depositors receive a deposition ID and a randomly generated password via email. Passwords currently cannot be reset or changed, so ORCiD login is recommended to avoid sharing personal passwords.  \n- Authors can be added, reordered, or removed from entries via the interface.  \n\n**Session Management:**  \n- Unsubmitted deposition sessions are saved for 3 months from the last login; afterward, the session and uploaded files are deleted with no access.  \n- Depositions for structure prediction competitions can be designated by selecting the \"Prediction Target\" option with the relevant initiative (e.g., CASP).  \n- Consecutive PDB accession numbers are not reserved or preassigned; they are issued based on submission time.  \n\n**ORCiD Requirements:**  \n- An ORCiD is mandatory for all contact authors before deposition. Registration is free and quick at www.orcid.org.  \n- While not required for all structure authors, providing ORCiDs is encouraged to distinguish individuals and assist journal manuscript submissions.  \n\n**Raw Data Deposition:**  \n- Depositors are strongly encouraged to archive raw data in curated repositories and provide corresponding DOIs in the \u201cRelated Entries\u201d section. Recommended archives include ProteiDiffraction.org, SBGrid, CXIDB, XRDa for X-ray data; EMPIAR for electron microscopy; and BMRB for NMR data.  \n- Raw image DOIs can be provided after deposition through communication with wwPDB.  \n\n**Access and Password Issues:**  \n- Depositors must use the deposition ID (starting with D_) and correct password to log in.  \n- Passwords can be retrieved via the \"Forgot Password\" link by submitting deposition ID and registered email; only registered emails at the time of deposition will receive password resets.  \n- Alternatively, ORCiD login bypasses the need for session passwords.  \n- Common reasons for not receiving password emails include incorrect email/ID, email not associated with the deposition, or emails filtered to spam.  \n\n**Replacing Data:**  \n- Authors can update coordinate files for released entries while retaining original PDB accession codes to preserve publication links.  \n- Updates are submitted via the OeDep communication panel or legacy email system.  \n- Only coordinate file changes are allowed; experimental data cannot be changed.  \n- Versioning is limited to one replacement per entry per year and three entries per Principal Investigator per year.  \n\n**Communication & Support:**  \n- Depositors can contact wwPDB biocuration staff via the Communication page within the deposition interface for specific entries.  \n- General feedback can be sent to deposit-help@mail.wwpdb.org if not tied to a specific deposition.  \n\nThis summary reflects the key points and numeric details from the provided sections related to deposition sessions, author management, ORCiD use, raw data submission, password retrieval, data replacement rules, and communication avenues.",

              "content": "The Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) manages the release and curation of structural data entries with a defined protocol. Authors submit entries and typically review and approve curated data before release. If authors do not respond within three weeks after receiving the validation report and there are no issues, wwPDB considers the entry approved and releases it once the associated publication is available. Authors may withdraw unreleased entries before publication; withdrawn entries remain listed with a \"WDRN\" status and their latest processed files are preserved for possible future re-deposition.\n\nProblematic entries identified by wwPDB biocurators\u2014due to unusual chemistry, sequence mismatches, or other concerns\u2014are discussed with authors for resolution. Unresolved issues after one year lead to withdrawal unless a related publication exists, in which case the entry may be released with a caveat. Withdrawn status can be reversed if the entry is later published. Coordinate and experimental data are always released together, sharing the same release status (REL for immediate release, HPUB for Hold until Publication, or HOLD for date-specific hold). Deadlines for release requests align with weekly update cycles.\n\nUnreleased entries display limited public information such as title, authorship, status, unique PDB ID, and experimental data availability, but sensitive details may be suppressed at the author\u2019s request. PDB IDs and ligand codes are assigned automatically upon deposition completion and cannot be requested or reserved by authors. Authors may update coordinates, experimental data, and metadata any time before release. After release, minor updates (e.g., citation corrections or small format fixes) are allowed freely, while major revisions (changes to coordinates, chemical composition, or sequence) occur via formal depositor- or wwPDB-initiated updates.\n\nWeekly processing involves data integrity checks, with correspondence deadlines for authors typically at noon Thursday local time at processing sites. Released data are synchronized weekly across all wwPDB FTP sites. Access to unreleased data is restricted to authors, with limited metadata sometimes publicly available if authors permit. Journal reviewers and users cannot obtain unreleased data from wwPDB but are encouraged to request validation reports from authors during manuscript review.\n\nRelease policies specify that REL entries are released promptly after author approval, or automatically after three weeks if no response is received and no issues exist. HPUB and HOLD entries remain on hold until publication or one year from deposition, whichever is first. If not released after one year, entries must be either released or withdrawn. Ten months after deposition, wwPDB contacts authors of unreleased entries to decide release or withdrawal. Publication detection via accession codes in literature triggers automatic release of HPUB entries. The wwPDB supports open science by promoting immediate data release coinciding with publication and manages post-release revisions under a versioning system.",

Author personal data remain private apart from publicly shown last names, initials, and citation authorship.\n\nwwPDB staff biocurate entries by checking metadata-data consistency, visually inspecting data quality, and ensuring map-model agreement. Communication with authors resolves issues; unresolved cases receive WAIT status or are escalated. After curation, authors have three weeks to review, with silence implying approval.\n\nOfficial wwPDB EM validation reports follow biocuration, aiding manuscript submissions.\n\nEntry statuses indicate progress, including AUTH (awaiting approval), HOLD (held up to one year), HPUB (held until publication or one year), REL (released), OBS (obsolete), WDRN (withdrawn pre-release), among others.\n\nReleasing an entry requires meeting all deposition, biocuration, validation, metadata, and PDB policy criteria. Authors select release instructions during deposition: Immediate Release (REL), Hold Until Publication (HPUB), or Hold (HOLD). Entries on hold must release or withdraw within one year; authors are contacted at ten months. Entries citing publications cannot be withdrawn and will be released. Weekly public releases occur Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC, with release requests deadlines Thursdays at noon local time.\n\nModifications before release are possible via wwPDB communication; after release, primary maps cannot be altered and require obsoletion and new entries for updates. Minor metadata/file changes after release must be justified.\n\nRemoval options include obsoletion (OBS) for released entries\u2014moved to an archived but public section with new accession codes required for replacements\u2014and withdrawal (WDRN) for unpublished entries, which are removed from public access and never reassigned codes. Withdrawal is not allowed once a primary citation is known. Exceptional circumstances like retractions may prompt obsoletion with author communication.\n\nOverall, these processes ensure EMDB entries are accurate, properly documented, timely released in line with publications, and maintain data integrity and public accessibility.",

Depositable data include atomic coordinates, experimental restraints (NOE, dihedral angles, RDCs, hydrogen bonds), chemical shifts, peak lists, and experimental metadata. While PDB archives 3D coordinates, restraints, and shifts, BMRB accepts detailed NMR data even without coordinates.\n\nThe deposition process requires uploading files in specific formats (e.g., mmCIF, PDB, NMR-STAR, NEF), providing thorough metadata (pH, temperature, solvent, labeling), reviewing an automatic NMR validation report covering structure and data quality, resolving any issues, and submitting to obtain accession codes. Validation checks include geometry, restraint violations, chemical shifts, and ensemble analysis. Common errors involve formatting and file inconsistencies, with online validation tools available prior to submission. Depositions are usually required before or during journal peer review; public release can be delayed until publication. Validation reports are provided in PDF and XML formats.\n\nAdditional policies govern submission and session management: initial uploads generate preliminary validation reports, followed by confidential wwPDB curator reviews. Depositors must download and acknowledge validation reports to proceed. Files can be replaced before accession code assignment via the \u201cRe-upload files\u201d page; large changes may require metadata resets. Post-submission replacements need curator approval, with limitations on coordinate file updates after release (one replacement per entry per year, max three entries per Principal Investigator annually). Unsubmitted sessions expire after three months.\n\nORCiD login is mandatory for all contact authors and recommended for all contributors; first-time contact authors must verify their email. Depositors receive a deposition ID and a non-resettable password unless logging in via ORCiD. Author lists can be edited during deposition. Accessions are issued sequentially without preassignment.\n\nDepositors are encouraged to archive raw experimental data in recommended repositories (e.g., ProteiDiffraction.org, EMPIAR, BMRB) and provide related DOIs during or after deposition. The wwPDB annotation process may alter chain IDs and residue numbering for uniqueness; depositors should not modify these. The standalone wwPDB Validation Server differs from OneDep and is not directly usable for deposition validation but offers API access.\n\nCommunication with wwPDB biocurators is facilitated through the deposition interface\u2019s Communication page or via deposit-help@mail.wwpdb.org. Overall, successful NMR data deposition requires strict adherence to file standards, comprehensive metadata supply, thorough validation review, ORCiD use, and ongoing coordination with wwPDB staff through the OneDep system.",

These accession codes increase incrementally and remain unchanged once assigned.\n\n**Deposition Process:**  \n- Data (maps converted to standard CCP4 format) and metadata are submitted via OneDep and validated by the system with wwPDB staff support as needed.  \n- Contact and author personal data (names, email, ORCID, etc.) are collected but kept private except last names, initials, and citation authors which are public.\n\n**Biocuration Process:**  \n- wwPDB staff check for discrepancies between metadata and data (e.g., resolution mismatches) and visually inspect EM data quality, ensuring map and model coordinate consistency.  \n- Issues found are communicated to contact authors; unresolved issues lead to a status of WAIT or referral to wwPDB PIs.  \n- Following curation, entries undergo author review with a three-week response period assumed as approval if no communication occurs.\n\n**Validation:**  \n- Official wwPDB EM validation reports are generated post-biocuration to assess map and model quality and are recommended for use during manuscript submission and review.\n\n**Entry Status Codes:**  \n- Status codes convey the current state, including:  \n  - AUTH (annotated, awaiting approval)  \n  - HOLD (on hold for up to one year)  \n  - HPUB (on hold until publication or one year)  \n  - OBS (obsolete)  \n  - POLC (awaiting policy decision)  \n  - PROC (being processed)  \n  - REFI (awaiting publication for maps derived from archived data by other groups)  \n  - REL (released)  \n  - REPL (replaced primary map, not processed)  \n  - WAIT (awaiting more info)  \n  - WDRN (withdrawn pre-release)\n\n**Release Requirements and Instructions:**  \n- Release requires fulfillment of deposition requirements, completion of biocuration and validation, metadata consistency, and PDB policy adherence for associated atomic models.  \n- Release instructions, chosen during deposition, include:  \n  - Immediate Release (REL) \u2014 released once approved.  \n  - Hold Until Publication (HPUB) \u2014 held up to one year or until publication.  \n  - Hold (HOLD) \u2014 held up to one year.  \n- Entries on hold must be released or withdrawn by one year post-deposition. Authors are contacted ten months after deposition to confirm intentions.  \n- Entries citing publications cannot be withdrawn and will be released by wwPDB.  \n- EMDB conducts weekly public releases on Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC, with deadlines for release requests at noon Thursdays (local time).\n\n**Modification of Entries:**  \n- Before release, most issues can be addressed via communication with wwPDB; depositions are locked post-submission but may be temporarily unlocked sparingly.  \n- After release, primary maps cannot be changed; obsoletion with superseding new entries is required for updates. Minor metadata or additional file changes must be justified and coordinated with wwPDB.\n\n**Entry Removal:**  \n- Obsoletion (OBS) applies to released entries moved to a separate archive section but remains publicly accessible; superseding requires a new EMDB accession code.  \n- Withdrawal (WDRN) applies only to unreleased entries with no public data; withdrawn codes are never reused, and entries appear on an unreleased list.  \n- Entries cannot be withdrawn once a primary citation is known to wwPDB.  \n- Unusual circumstances (e.g., publication retractions or investigative findings) may prompt obsoletion requests, with efforts made to communicate with authors.\n\nOverall, the process ensures EMDB entries\u2019 quality, proper documentation, timely release aligned with publication, and maintenance of data integrity and public accessibility.",

Validation and Submission:\n- Uploaded files generate an automatic preliminary validation report; an official confidential report follows from wwPDB biocurators.\n- The validation report must be downloaded and reviewed before completing deposition, as failure to acknowledge it can block submission.\n- A progress bar tracks completion of required data, turning into a Submit button once ready.\n- Successful submissions receive accession codes, followed by annotation and processing.\n\n2. File Replacement:\n- Files can be replaced before accession code issuance via the \u201cRe-upload files\u201d page by selecting and uploading new files while deselecting old ones.\n- Issues during upload can be diagnosed on the \u201cUpload Summary\u201d page.\n- Major changes requiring metadata resets use the \u201cClear deposition data\u201d button, which deletes metadata and requires re-entry.\n- Post-submission replacements need biocurator assistance to unlock sessions; withdrawn or obsolete deposits cannot be changed.\n- Only coordinate file updates are allowed after release, with version limits of one replacement per entry per year and three entries per Principal Investigator annually.\n\n3. Session and Author Management:\n- Depositors should log in via ORCiD for secure access; first-time contact authors must verify their email.\n- Unsubmitted sessions expire after 3 months of inactivity, resulting in deletion of session data.\n- Depositors receive a deposition ID starting with D_ and a randomly generated password via email, which currently cannot be reset or changed; ORCiD login is therefore preferred.\n- Authors can be added, reordered, or removed via the interface.\n- Consecutive PDB accession numbers are not preassigned, issued based on submission timing.\n\n4. ORCiD Requirements and Raw Data:\n- An ORCiD is mandatory for all contact authors prior to deposition; registration is free and encouraged for all structure authors.\n- Depositors are urged to archive raw data in recommended repositories (e.g., ProteiDiffraction.org, EMPIAR, BMRB) and provide DOIs in \u201cRelated Entries.\u201d\n- Raw data DOIs can also be provided post-deposition via communication with wwPDB.\n\n5.

              "content": "The document provides detailed guidelines for depositing molecular structures, NMR data, cryo-EM, and other macromolecular structural data via the wwPDB OneDep system and related repositories to ensure accuracy, standardization, and reproducibility.\n\nFor molecular structures and NMR data, the process involves uploading files (e.g., mmCIF, PDB, NMR-STAR, NEF), correcting errors, matching chemical components, submitting detailed polymer sequences (including unknown residues), and entering funding and precise assembly (quaternary structure) information with evidence. NMR depositions require atomic coordinates, experimental restraints, chemical shifts, peak lists, and metadata like pH and temperature. Automatic validation reports check geometry, restraints, chemical shifts, and ensembles; depositors must address errors before final submission, typically linked with journal peer review. Validation reports are provided in PDF and XML format. Policies include confidential curator reviews, mandatory acknowledgment of reports, controlled file replacement (limited coordinate updates post-release), and session expiration after three months. ORCiD login is mandatory for contact authors, with email verification for first-time users. Depositors receive deposition IDs and non-resettable passwords unless using ORCiD. Author lists can be edited during deposition; accession codes are sequentially assigned upon release. Raw data archiving with DOIs is encouraged. The wwPDB annotation process may modify chain IDs and residue numbering, which depositors should not alter. The standalone wwPDB Validation Server is distinct from OneDep and unsuitable for deposition validation but offers API access. Communication with biocurators occurs via the interface or email.\n\nFor cryo-EM data depositions, composite maps plus atomic models must be submitted, with separate but linked global consensus and focused maps. Atomic models can be fitted or derived from existing PDB structures and validated using EMRinger, MolProbity, Q-scores, and FSC metrics (requiring standardized XML submissions). Models can be updated without changing PDB IDs, but maps are immutable post-release; corrections need new depositions. Raw data should be linked via EMPIAR accessions. Only one model per EM entry is allowed, and modeling should be confined to well-defined density areas; speculative modeling is discouraged. Helical reconstructions count filament subsections as segments. Multiple additional maps can be uploaded, though validation focuses on primary map and model. Tools like pdb_extract assist in metadata and composite map deposition. EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 formats but distributes maps in CCP4 format. Structural releases linked to publications occur promptly, with delays mostly due to metadata mismatches.\n\nGeneral macromolecular structure deposition requires completing administrative fields and linking related entries when applicable. Metadata templates and tools like the RCSB PDB Group Deposition system support submitting multiple related structures with shared data. Large or symmetric structures require specific formats and auxiliary files. Differences between depositor input and validation reports in chain IDs or residue numbering require no depositor action. Required files differ by method (e.g., 3DEM demands primary maps, half-maps, and images); raw image data should be linked with DOIs. Detailed sample, ligand, processing, and refinement information must be provided. Depositor contact information, including email, country, and ORCiD, is mandatory. Rapid submission and low-traffic periods improve chances for consecutive PDB IDs. Re-refinements must reference original PDB IDs with appropriate content descriptors. Multiple experimental methods can be indicated; purely theoretical models are excluded. Missing software entries can be requested via curators. MmCIF files should ideally be produced by refinement software or pdb_extract; structure factor files can be converted with special tools. The upload system supports all necessary files per experimental method.\n\nTogether, these practices foster comprehensive, standardized, and transparent deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular data, enhancing data quality, sharing, and reuse in structural biology.",

If the contact author(s)has any issues with the EMDB entry,these can be raised with the wwPDB staff Once approved the EMDB entry status ischanged to that of the release instruction and an emailnotification is automatically sent to the contact author(s).\u00b7 Upon release,the files associated with the EMDB entry will be made available in the public archive.\u00b7 The deadline for release requests is 12:00 noon on Thursday (local time at processing site).\u00b7 EMDB weekly release is every Wednesday at 0:oo UTC\u00b7EMDB entries are available from the wwPDB distribution sites(EMDB,RCSB and PDBj). Instructions to retrieve EMDB data files and metadata are posted on the wwPDB website.6. Modification of entries6.1 Entry changes before releaseBefore public release, most issues can be resolved by communicating with wwPDB staf.After sumission of an EMDB entry,thedeposition is locked for further modifications and changes. Additional data or information may be required, in which case thedeposition may be temporarily unlocked by wwPDB staff. This option is used sparingly to avoid creating inconsistencies in themetadata.6.2 Entry changes after releaseIn some cases, it may be necessary to modify an entry after release. This may apply to both the data and the metadata (e.g..update of the primary citation details). However, the primary map of an EMDB entry cannot be changed after release. Instead,the entry would need to be made bsolete and then replaced by an entrely new deposition. Occasionally, additional data filesmay need to be added or unintentionally uploaded files may need to be removed. Such changes should be discussed withwwPDB staff and should be justied by the contact author(s). Depending on the nature of the changes, it may take some time for them to be reflected in the public archive.7. Removal of entries7.1 Entry obsoletionAn EMDB entry can only be made obsolete after it has been released. Obsoleting an entry changes the status code of thedeposition to OBS and moves its files out of the active part of the public archive into a separate area of the archive where theEMDB entry willstillbe publily accessible. Entry obsoletion can be requested, and should be justified, by the contact author(s).Once acted upon, an email confirming the obsoletion is sent to the contact author(s). Obsoletion can be followed by",

              "content": "The provided text delivers comprehensive guidance on cryo-EM data deposition, validation, and related policies at wwPDB and EMDB, alongside detailed deposition procedures for macromolecular structures.\n\n**Cryo-EM Data Deposition and Validation (wwPDB/EMDB):**\n\n- Composite maps\u2014created by combining focused maps from targeted local refinement\u2014must be deposited with corresponding atomic models. Global consensus maps and each focused map should be submitted separately as standard single-particle entries, with explicit linking among them during deposition.\n- Key map types include consensus maps (global refinement), focused maps (region-specific refinement), and composite maps (combined focused maps).\n- Atomic coordinate deposition can include coordinates fitted to maps or those derived from rigid-body fitting of existing PDB structures, provided species and sequence match the EM sample precisely.\n- Validation employs tools like EMRinger and MolProbity to assess map-model fit, geometry, and other structural parameters.\n- Atomic models may be updated post-release without changing PDB IDs, but EM maps are immutable after release; corrections require new depositions with distinct accession codes.\n- Depositors should supply EMPIAR accession codes to link raw data with processed maps and models; these can be added post-deposition with curator help.\n- Map-only entries cannot later have models added; new depositions are required to combine maps and models.\n- Each EM entry accepts only one model file, which may contain multiple models; validation focuses on the first model, and all models must be clearly documented.\n- The primary map used for atomic model building must be designated in map+model depositions.\n- Modeling should be restricted to regions with confident density support; speculative modeling beyond map evidence is discouraged.\n- Q-scores measure local map-model agreement but may be low in flexible areas despite good visual fit. Discrepancies between reported and calculated resolutions often arise from data processing artifacts, emphasizing the importance of visual inspection and comparative analysis.\n- Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) data must be submitted in a standardized XML format for validation.\n- In helical reconstructions, \u201csegments\u201d are particle-like filament subsections; \u201cNumber of Segments Used\u201d counts these segments, not protofilaments.\n- Depositors are encouraged to upload unlimited additional maps (e.g., raw, sharpened) with detailed descriptions to facilitate reuse. Validation emphasizes the primary map, model, first mask, and initial half-maps.\n- The pdb_extract tool assists in generating metadata and preparing model and map-only mmCIF files for composite map depositions.\n- \u201cMaximum likelihood\u201d is the recommended angle assignment type for wwPDB deposition for software like CryoSPARC or RELION.\n- Nominal defocus refers to the microscope target value; calibrated defocus is the measured defocus reflecting actual experimental conditions.\n- Structures linked to publications are released promptly upon accession code identification; delays often stem from mismatched author or title information, which depositors should promptly update.\n- EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 map formats, converting all to CCP4 for distribution.\n\n**General Macromolecular Structure Deposition Procedures (wwPDB):**\n\n- Depositors must complete administrative fields before uploading. To deposit related entries, use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option with original IDs and passwords. After clicking \u201cContinue deposition,\u201d importing previous data requires starting a new session.\n- Metadata templates (prepared with pdb_extract) can be embedded within model files to automate and reuse metadata across related entries, reducing manual input.\n- The RCSB PDB Group Deposition system allows submission of multiple related structures in one compressed mmCIF file, requiring shared authorship and release policies; unique Group and PDB IDs are assigned upon submission.\n- pdb_extract harvests coordinate files, experimental data, logs, and templates to generate fully populated PDBx/mmCIF files. Refinement packages like Phenix and Refmac also generate mmCIF files with statistics.\n- PDB format files must follow strict formatting (e.g., complete TER records, correct HETATM lines). Large structures (>99,999 atoms or >62 chains) must use mmCIF format.\n- For symmetric structures, deposit only refined chains plus a file with symmetry operators.\n- Chain ID and residue numbering inconsistencies between input files and validation reports are due to wwPDB annotation assigning unique chain IDs; depositors do not need to modify them.\n- File uploads vary by method:\n  - X-ray/electrocrystallography: coordinate plus structure factor files.\n  - NMR: coordinate, chemical shift, and at least one restraint file; peak lists encouraged.\n  - 3DEM single particle/helical/subtomogram: primary map, two raw half-maps, no-copyright map image, coordinates if applicable; FSC curves, masks optional but encouraged.\n  - 3DEM tomography: primary map plus no-copyright map image; masks encouraged.\n  - 3DEM models derived from existing maps require coordinate files plus EMDB IDs.\n- Raw image data should be indicated as \u201cdiffraction image data\u201d on the Related Entries page with DOI provided.\n- Depositors must supply detailed protein/nucleic acid information (organism, preparation, sequence including tags/mutations), ligand chemical identity (SMILES, images, CCD IDs), and optionally processing/refinement logs.\n- Contact author email, country, and ORCiD are mandatory.\n- Multiple related entries can be deposited via reuse of metadata or the Group Deposition system.\n- To maximize chances of consecutive PDB IDs, complete all fields beforehand and submit quickly during low-traffic periods; simultaneous sessions are unsupported and consecutive ID assignment is not guaranteed.\n- Re-refined structures with existing experimental data require original PDB ID and selection of \u201cre-refinement\u201d content type; third-party reuse policies apply.\n- Multiple experimental methods may be selected, with multiple accession codes assigned. Unsupported methods are submitted via https://data.pdb-ihm.org/.\n- Purely theoretical computational models are not accepted; use the Model Archive instead.\n- Missing software information in the dropdown can be reported via the Communication page for curator update.\n- mmCIF files should ideally be generated by refinement software or wwPDB tools like pdb_extract.\n- Structure factor files can be converted with SF-tool or sf_covert.\n- The \u201cFile Upload\u201d interface accepts required files as specified per method.\n  \nThese rigorous guidelines ensure accurate, transparent, and reproducible deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular structural data, supporting high-quality data sharing and reuse within the structural biology community.",

              "content": "The provided text offers detailed guidance on depositing macromolecular structures using the wwPDB system, focusing on administrative steps, file preparation, metadata handling, and specific cases.\n\n1. **General Deposition Process:**\n   - Complete all relevant administrative fields before uploading.\n   - To deposit related entries, use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option by entering the original deposition ID and password to copy selected data categories.\n   - After uploading files and clicking \u201cContinue deposition,\u201d the import option becomes unavailable; a new session is required to import again.\n\n2. **Metadata Templates:**\n   - For entries sharing metadata (e.g., data collection, protein names, sequences), use a common metadata template prepared with pdb_extract.\n   - This template can be embedded within model files, automating field population and reducing manual entry.\n   - Templates can be saved, modified, and reused; instructions are available on the pdb_extract Help page.\n\n3. **Group Depositions:**\n   - The RCSB PDB Group Deposition system allows submitting multiple related structures in one compressed file.\n   - Requirements: files must be in mmCIF format, entries must share authorship and release policy.\n   - Upon submission, a Group ID and unique PDB ID for each structure are assigned.\n\n4. **File Preparation and Conversion:**\n   - pdb_extract harvests coordinate files, experimental data, processing logs, and author templates to generate fully populated PDBx/mmCIF files for validation and deposition.\n   - Programs such as Phenix and Refmac can also generate mmCIF files with refinement statistics.\n   - PDB format files can be converted to mmCIF using pdb_extract.\n   - For 3DEM and NMR depositions, uploaded PDB files are automatically converted to mmCIF with both versions available for download.\n   - Proper PDB format files must comply with the format guide (http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/v3.3.html), including complete TER records after each polymer chain and correct HETATM lines for ligands/compounds.\n\n5. **Structure Factor File Conversion:**\n   - Structure factor files can be converted to mmCIF using SF-tool or programmatically via sf_covert (https://pypi.org/project/sf-covert/2.1.13/).\n\n6. **Large Entries:**\n   - Structures exceeding 99,999 atoms or 62 chains must be deposited in PDBx/mmCIF format.\n   - For structures with exact symmetry, deposit only refined chains plus a PDB file with symmetry operators to generate the full assembly.\n\n7. **Chain ID and Residue Numbering:**\n   - Discrepancies between input files and validation reports are due to wwPDB annotation policies assigning unique chain IDs based on proximity.\n   - Depositors need not change chain IDs or residue numbers; wwPDB updates these during annotation.\n\n8. **Uploading Files:**\n   - Use the \"File Upload\" page within the deposition interface to upload coordinate and experimental data files.\n   - Required files vary by method:\n     - X-ray/electrocrystallography: one coordinate and one structure factor file.\n     - NMR: coordinate file, chemical shift file, and at least one restraint file; peak list upload is encouraged.\n     - 3DEM single particle, helical, subtomogram: primary map file, two raw half-map files, a no-copyright map image, coordinate file if applicable; FSC curves, masks, and layer lines are optional but encouraged.\n     - 3DEM tomography: primary map and no-copyright map image; masks encouraged.\n     - 3DEM models derived from previous maps require coordinate files plus associated EMDB ID.\n\n9. **Related Experimental Data:**\n   - For raw image data, specify \u201cdiffraction image data\u201d on the \u201cRelated entries\u201d page and provide the DOI.\n\n10. **Information and Files Needed for Deposition:**\n    - Detailed protein/nucleic acid information: source organism, preparation method, experimental sequence (including expression tags, mutations, disordered regions).\n    - Ligands/compounds must have chemical identity information (SMILES, 2D image, molecular definition, or known CCD ID).\n    - Processing and refinement log files are recommended, ideally included via pdb_extract.\n    - Contact authors\u2019 email, country affiliation, and ORCiD are mandatory.\n\n11. **Multiple Related Entries:**\n    - Two main approaches:\n      1. Use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option to reuse administrative metadata.\n      2. Use the Group Deposition system for multiple related structures.\n\n12. **Consecutive PDB IDs:**\n    - To enhance chances of obtaining consecutive PDB IDs for multiple entries, complete all fields in advance, submit sessions quickly in succession, and choose low-traffic times.\n    - Note: Consecutive ID assignment is not guaranteed; the system does not support simultaneous sessions.\n\n13. **Re-Refined Structures with Existing Experimental Data:**\n    - Provide the original PDB ID, select \u201cre-refinement\u201d as content type.\n    - Follow third-party data reuse policies if the original data belongs to a different group.\n\n14. **Experimental Methods:**\n    - Multiple experimental methods can be selected during deposition.\n    - For hybrid methods (e.g., X-ray and neutron), multiple accession codes will be assigned upon submission.\n    - For unsupported methods, submit via https://data.pdb-ihm.org/.\n\n15. **Computational Models:**\n    - Purely theoretical computational models are not accepted in PDB; use the Model Archive (https://www.modelarchive.org).\n\n16. **Software Information Missing in Dropdown:**\n    - Provide missing software details via the Communication page; annotators will guide and update the entry.\n\n17. **Preparing mmCIF Format Files:**\n    - Use refinement software outputs or wwPDB tools (https://pdb-extract.wwpdb.org/) for generating mmCIF files.\n    - Recommended to deposit mmCIF files generated by refinement packages.\n\nThis summary covers all essential instructions and requirements for file preparation, metadata, experimental data, and deposition procedures described in the provided text, preserving all specified details and numerical values.",

NMR depositions require atomic coordinates, experimental restraints, chemical shifts, peak lists, and metadata like pH and temperature. Automatic validation reports check geometry, restraints, chemical shifts, and ensembles; depositors must address errors before final submission, typically linked with journal peer review. Validation reports are provided in PDF and XML format. Policies include confidential curator reviews, mandatory acknowledgment of reports, controlled file replacement (limited coordinate updates post-release), and session expiration after three months. ORCiD login is mandatory for contact authors, with email verification for first-time users. Depositors receive deposition IDs and non-resettable passwords unless using ORCiD. Author lists can be edited during deposition; accession codes are sequentially assigned upon release. Raw data archiving with DOIs is encouraged. The wwPDB annotation process may modify chain IDs and residue numbering, which depositors should not alter. The standalone wwPDB Validation Server is distinct from OneDep and unsuitable for deposition validation but offers API access. Communication with biocurators occurs via the interface or email.\n\nFor cryo-EM data depositions, composite maps plus atomic models must be submitted, with separate but linked global consensus and focused maps. Atomic models can be fitted or derived from existing PDB structures and validated using EMRinger, MolProbity, Q-scores, and FSC metrics (requiring standardized XML submissions). Models can be updated without changing PDB IDs, but maps are immutable post-release; corrections need new depositions. Raw data should be linked via EMPIAR accessions. Only one model per EM entry is allowed, and modeling should be confined to well-defined density areas; speculative modeling is discouraged. Helical reconstructions count filament subsections as segments. Multiple additional maps can be uploaded, though validation focuses on primary map and model. Tools like pdb_extract assist in metadata and composite map deposition. EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 formats but distributes maps in CCP4 format. Structural releases linked to publications occur promptly, with delays mostly due to metadata mismatches.\n\nGeneral macromolecular structure deposition requires completing administrative fields and linking related entries when applicable. Metadata templates and tools like the RCSB PDB Group Deposition system support submitting multiple related structures with shared data. Large or symmetric structures require specific formats and auxiliary files. Differences between depositor input and validation reports in chain IDs or residue numbering require no depositor action. Required files differ by method (e.g., 3DEM demands primary maps, half-maps, and images); raw image data should be linked with DOIs. Detailed sample, ligand, processing, and refinement information must be provided. Depositor contact information, including email, country, and ORCiD, is mandatory. Rapid submission and low-traffic periods improve chances for consecutive PDB IDs. Re-refinements must reference original PDB IDs with appropriate content descriptors. Multiple experimental methods can be indicated; purely theoretical models are excluded. Missing software entries can be requested via curators. MmCIF files should ideally be produced by refinement software or pdb_extract; structure factor files can be converted with special tools. The upload system supports all necessary files per experimental method.\n\nTogether, these practices foster comprehensive, standardized, and transparent deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular data, enhancing data quality, sharing, and reuse in structural biology.",

Modification of entries6.1 Entry changes before releaseBefore public release, most issues can be resolved by communicating with wwPDB staf.After sumission of an EMDB entry,thedeposition is locked for further modifications and changes. Additional data or information may be required, in which case thedeposition may be temporarily unlocked by wwPDB staff. This option is used sparingly to avoid creating inconsistencies in themetadata.6.2 Entry changes after releaseIn some cases, it may be necessary to modify an entry after release. This may apply to both the data and the metadata (e.g..update of the primary citation details). However, the primary map of an EMDB entry cannot be changed after release. Instead,the entry would need to be made bsolete and then replaced by an entrely new deposition. Occasionally, additional data filesmay need to be added or unintentionally uploaded files may need to be removed. Such changes should be discussed withwwPDB staff and should be justied by the contact author(s). Depending on the nature of the changes, it may take some time for them to be reflected in the public archive.7. Removal of entries7.1 Entry obsoletionAn EMDB entry can only be made obsolete after it has been released. Obsoleting an entry changes the status code of thedeposition to OBS and moves its files out of the active part of the public archive into a separate area of the archive where theEMDB entry willstillbe publily accessible. Entry obsoletion can be requested, and should be justified, by the contact author(s).Once acted upon, an email confirming the obsoletion is sent to the contact author(s). Obsoletion can be followed by",

              "content": "The provided text delivers comprehensive guidance on cryo-EM data deposition, validation, and related policies at wwPDB and EMDB, alongside detailed deposition procedures for macromolecular structures.\n\n**Cryo-EM Data Deposition and Validation (wwPDB/EMDB):**\n\n- Composite maps\u2014created by combining focused maps from targeted local refinement\u2014must be deposited with corresponding atomic models. Global consensus maps and each focused map should be submitted separately as standard single-particle entries, with explicit linking among them during deposition.\n- Key map types include consensus maps (global refinement), focused maps (region-specific refinement), and composite maps (combined focused maps).\n- Atomic coordinate deposition can include coordinates fitted to maps or those derived from rigid-body fitting of existing PDB structures, provided species and sequence match the EM sample precisely.\n- Validation employs tools like EMRinger and MolProbity to assess map-model fit, geometry, and other structural parameters.\n- Atomic models may be updated post-release without changing PDB IDs, but EM maps are immutable after release; corrections require new depositions with distinct accession codes.\n- Depositors should supply EMPIAR accession codes to link raw data with processed maps and models; these can be added post-deposition with curator help.\n- Map-only entries cannot later have models added; new depositions are required to combine maps and models.\n- Each EM entry accepts only one model file, which may contain multiple models; validation focuses on the first model, and all models must be clearly documented.\n- The primary map used for atomic model building must be designated in map+model depositions.\n- Modeling should be restricted to regions with confident density support; speculative modeling beyond map evidence is discouraged.\n- Q-scores measure local map-model agreement but may be low in flexible areas despite good visual fit. Discrepancies between reported and calculated resolutions often arise from data processing artifacts, emphasizing the importance of visual inspection and comparative analysis.\n- Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) data must be submitted in a standardized XML format for validation.\n- In helical reconstructions, \u201csegments\u201d are particle-like filament subsections; \u201cNumber of Segments Used\u201d counts these segments, not protofilaments.\n- Depositors are encouraged to upload unlimited additional maps (e.g., raw, sharpened) with detailed descriptions to facilitate reuse. Validation emphasizes the primary map, model, first mask, and initial half-maps.\n- The pdb_extract tool assists in generating metadata and preparing model and map-only mmCIF files for composite map depositions.\n- \u201cMaximum likelihood\u201d is the recommended angle assignment type for wwPDB deposition for software like CryoSPARC or RELION.\n- Nominal defocus refers to the microscope target value; calibrated defocus is the measured defocus reflecting actual experimental conditions.\n- Structures linked to publications are released promptly upon accession code identification; delays often stem from mismatched author or title information, which depositors should promptly update.\n- EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 map formats, converting all to CCP4 for distribution.\n\n**General Macromolecular Structure Deposition Procedures (wwPDB):**\n\n- Depositors must complete administrative fields before uploading. To deposit related entries, use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option with original IDs and passwords. After clicking \u201cContinue deposition,\u201d importing previous data requires starting a new session.\n- Metadata templates (prepared with pdb_extract) can be embedded within model files to automate and reuse metadata across related entries, reducing manual input.\n- The RCSB PDB Group Deposition system allows submission of multiple related structures in one compressed mmCIF file, requiring shared authorship and release policies; unique Group and PDB IDs are assigned upon submission.\n- pdb_extract harvests coordinate files, experimental data, logs, and templates to generate fully populated PDBx/mmCIF files. Refinement packages like Phenix and Refmac also generate mmCIF files with statistics.\n- PDB format files must follow strict formatting (e.g., complete TER records, correct HETATM lines). Large structures (>99,999 atoms or >62 chains) must use mmCIF format.\n- For symmetric structures, deposit only refined chains plus a file with symmetry operators.\n- Chain ID and residue numbering inconsistencies between input files and validation reports are due to wwPDB annotation assigning unique chain IDs; depositors do not need to modify them.\n- File uploads vary by method:\n  - X-ray/electrocrystallography: coordinate plus structure factor files.\n  - NMR: coordinate, chemical shift, and at least one restraint file; peak lists encouraged.\n  - 3DEM single particle/helical/subtomogram: primary map, two raw half-maps, no-copyright map image, coordinates if applicable; FSC curves, masks optional but encouraged.\n  - 3DEM tomography: primary map plus no-copyright map image; masks encouraged.\n  - 3DEM models derived from existing maps require coordinate files plus EMDB IDs.\n- Raw image data should be indicated as \u201cdiffraction image data\u201d on the Related Entries page with DOI provided.\n- Depositors must supply detailed protein/nucleic acid information (organism, preparation, sequence including tags/mutations), ligand chemical identity (SMILES, images, CCD IDs), and optionally processing/refinement logs.\n- Contact author email, country, and ORCiD are mandatory.\n- Multiple related entries can be deposited via reuse of metadata or the Group Deposition system.\n- To maximize chances of consecutive PDB IDs, complete all fields beforehand and submit quickly during low-traffic periods; simultaneous sessions are unsupported and consecutive ID assignment is not guaranteed.\n- Re-refined structures with existing experimental data require original PDB ID and selection of \u201cre-refinement\u201d content type; third-party reuse policies apply.\n- Multiple experimental methods may be selected, with multiple accession codes assigned. Unsupported methods are submitted via https://data.pdb-ihm.org/.\n- Purely theoretical computational models are not accepted; use the Model Archive instead.\n- Missing software information in the dropdown can be reported via the Communication page for curator update.\n- mmCIF files should ideally be generated by refinement software or wwPDB tools like pdb_extract.\n- Structure factor files can be converted with SF-tool or sf_covert.\n- The \u201cFile Upload\u201d interface accepts required files as specified per method.\n  \nThese rigorous guidelines ensure accurate, transparent, and reproducible deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular structural data, supporting high-quality data sharing and reuse within the structural biology community.",

              "content": "The provided text offers detailed guidance on depositing macromolecular structures using the wwPDB system, focusing on administrative steps, file preparation, metadata handling, and specific cases.\n\n1. **General Deposition Process:**\n   - Complete all relevant administrative fields before uploading.\n   - To deposit related entries, use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option by entering the original deposition ID and password to copy selected data categories.\n   - After uploading files and clicking \u201cContinue deposition,\u201d the import option becomes unavailable; a new session is required to import again.\n\n2. **Metadata Templates:**\n   - For entries sharing metadata (e.g., data collection, protein names, sequences), use a common metadata template prepared with pdb_extract.\n   - This template can be embedded within model files, automating field population and reducing manual entry.\n   - Templates can be saved, modified, and reused; instructions are available on the pdb_extract Help page.\n\n3. **Group Depositions:**\n   - The RCSB PDB Group Deposition system allows submitting multiple related structures in one compressed file.\n   - Requirements: files must be in mmCIF format, entries must share authorship and release policy.\n   - Upon submission, a Group ID and unique PDB ID for each structure are assigned.\n\n4. **File Preparation and Conversion:**\n   - pdb_extract harvests coordinate files, experimental data, processing logs, and author templates to generate fully populated PDBx/mmCIF files for validation and deposition.\n   - Programs such as Phenix and Refmac can also generate mmCIF files with refinement statistics.\n   - PDB format files can be converted to mmCIF using pdb_extract.\n   - For 3DEM and NMR depositions, uploaded PDB files are automatically converted to mmCIF with both versions available for download.\n   - Proper PDB format files must comply with the format guide (http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/v3.3.html), including complete TER records after each polymer chain and correct HETATM lines for ligands/compounds.\n\n5. **Structure Factor File Conversion:**\n   - Structure factor files can be converted to mmCIF using SF-tool or programmatically via sf_covert (https://pypi.org/project/sf-covert/2.1.13/).\n\n6. **Large Entries:**\n   - Structures exceeding 99,999 atoms or 62 chains must be deposited in PDBx/mmCIF format.\n   - For structures with exact symmetry, deposit only refined chains plus a PDB file with symmetry operators to generate the full assembly.\n\n7. **Chain ID and Residue Numbering:**\n   - Discrepancies between input files and validation reports are due to wwPDB annotation policies assigning unique chain IDs based on proximity.\n   - Depositors need not change chain IDs or residue numbers; wwPDB updates these during annotation.\n\n8. **Uploading Files:**\n   - Use the \"File Upload\" page within the deposition interface to upload coordinate and experimental data files.\n   - Required files vary by method:\n     - X-ray/electrocrystallography: one coordinate and one structure factor file.\n     - NMR: coordinate file, chemical shift file, and at least one restraint file; peak list upload is encouraged.\n     - 3DEM single particle, helical, subtomogram: primary map file, two raw half-map files, a no-copyright map image, coordinate file if applicable; FSC curves, masks, and layer lines are optional but encouraged.\n     - 3DEM tomography: primary map and no-copyright map image; masks encouraged.\n     - 3DEM models derived from previous maps require coordinate files plus associated EMDB ID.\n\n9. **Related Experimental Data:**\n   - For raw image data, specify \u201cdiffraction image data\u201d on the \u201cRelated entries\u201d page and provide the DOI.\n\n10. **Information and Files Needed for Deposition:**\n    - Detailed protein/nucleic acid information: source organism, preparation method, experimental sequence (including expression tags, mutations, disordered regions).\n    - Ligands/compounds must have chemical identity information (SMILES, 2D image, molecular definition, or known CCD ID).\n    - Processing and refinement log files are recommended, ideally included via pdb_extract.\n    - Contact authors\u2019 email, country affiliation, and ORCiD are mandatory.\n\n11. **Multiple Related Entries:**\n    - Two main approaches:\n      1. Use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option to reuse administrative metadata.\n      2. Use the Group Deposition system for multiple related structures.\n\n12. **Consecutive PDB IDs:**\n    - To enhance chances of obtaining consecutive PDB IDs for multiple entries, complete all fields in advance, submit sessions quickly in succession, and choose low-traffic times.\n    - Note: Consecutive ID assignment is not guaranteed; the system does not support simultaneous sessions.\n\n13. **Re-Refined Structures with Existing Experimental Data:**\n    - Provide the original PDB ID, select \u201cre-refinement\u201d as content type.\n    - Follow third-party data reuse policies if the original data belongs to a different group.\n\n14. **Experimental Methods:**\n    - Multiple experimental methods can be selected during deposition.\n    - For hybrid methods (e.g., X-ray and neutron), multiple accession codes will be assigned upon submission.\n    - For unsupported methods, submit via https://data.pdb-ihm.org/.\n\n15. **Computational Models:**\n    - Purely theoretical computational models are not accepted in PDB; use the Model Archive (https://www.modelarchive.org).\n\n16. **Software Information Missing in Dropdown:**\n    - Provide missing software details via the Communication page; annotators will guide and update the entry.\n\n17. **Preparing mmCIF Format Files:**\n    - Use refinement software outputs or wwPDB tools (https://pdb-extract.wwpdb.org/) for generating mmCIF files.\n    - Recommended to deposit mmCIF files generated by refinement packages.\n\nThis summary covers all essential instructions and requirements for file preparation, metadata, experimental data, and deposition procedures described in the provided text, preserving all specified details and numerical values.",

NMR depositions require atomic coordinates, experimental restraints, chemical shifts, peak lists, and metadata like pH and temperature. Automatic validation reports check geometry, restraints, chemical shifts, and ensembles; depositors must address errors before final submission, typically linked with journal peer review. Validation reports are provided in PDF and XML format. Policies include confidential curator reviews, mandatory acknowledgment of reports, controlled file replacement (limited coordinate updates post-release), and session expiration after three months. ORCiD login is mandatory for contact authors, with email verification for first-time users. Depositors receive deposition IDs and non-resettable passwords unless using ORCiD. Author lists can be edited during deposition; accession codes are sequentially assigned upon release. Raw data archiving with DOIs is encouraged. The wwPDB annotation process may modify chain IDs and residue numbering, which depositors should not alter. The standalone wwPDB Validation Server is distinct from OneDep and unsuitable for deposition validation but offers API access. Communication with biocurators occurs via the interface or email.\n\nFor cryo-EM data depositions, composite maps plus atomic models must be submitted, with separate but linked global consensus and focused maps. Atomic models can be fitted or derived from existing PDB structures and validated using EMRinger, MolProbity, Q-scores, and FSC metrics (requiring standardized XML submissions). Models can be updated without changing PDB IDs, but maps are immutable post-release; corrections need new depositions. Raw data should be linked via EMPIAR accessions. Only one model per EM entry is allowed, and modeling should be confined to well-defined density areas; speculative modeling is discouraged. Helical reconstructions count filament subsections as segments. Multiple additional maps can be uploaded, though validation focuses on primary map and model. Tools like pdb_extract assist in metadata and composite map deposition. EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 formats but distributes maps in CCP4 format. Structural releases linked to publications occur promptly, with delays mostly due to metadata mismatches.\n\nGeneral macromolecular structure deposition requires completing administrative fields and linking related entries when applicable. Metadata templates and tools like the RCSB PDB Group Deposition system support submitting multiple related structures with shared data. Large or symmetric structures require specific formats and auxiliary files. Differences between depositor input and validation reports in chain IDs or residue numbering require no depositor action. Required files differ by method (e.g., 3DEM demands primary maps, half-maps, and images); raw image data should be linked with DOIs. Detailed sample, ligand, processing, and refinement information must be provided. Depositor contact information, including email, country, and ORCiD, is mandatory. Rapid submission and low-traffic periods improve chances for consecutive PDB IDs. Re-refinements must reference original PDB IDs with appropriate content descriptors. Multiple experimental methods can be indicated; purely theoretical models are excluded. Missing software entries can be requested via curators. MmCIF files should ideally be produced by refinement software or pdb_extract; structure factor files can be converted with special tools. The upload system supports all necessary files per experimental method.\n\nTogether, these practices foster comprehensive, standardized, and transparent deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular data, enhancing data quality, sharing, and reuse in structural biology.",

Modification of entries6.1 Entry changes before releaseBefore public release, most issues can be resolved by communicating with wwPDB staf.After sumission of an EMDB entry,thedeposition is locked for further modifications and changes. Additional data or information may be required, in which case thedeposition may be temporarily unlocked by wwPDB staff. This option is used sparingly to avoid creating inconsistencies in themetadata.6.2 Entry changes after releaseIn some cases, it may be necessary to modify an entry after release. This may apply to both the data and the metadata (e.g..update of the primary citation details). However, the primary map of an EMDB entry cannot be changed after release. Instead,the entry would need to be made bsolete and then replaced by an entrely new deposition. Occasionally, additional data filesmay need to be added or unintentionally uploaded files may need to be removed. Such changes should be discussed withwwPDB staff and should be justied by the contact author(s). Depending on the nature of the changes, it may take some time for them to be reflected in the public archive.7. Removal of entries7.1 Entry obsoletionAn EMDB entry can only be made obsolete after it has been released. Obsoleting an entry changes the status code of thedeposition to OBS and moves its files out of the active part of the public archive into a separate area of the archive where theEMDB entry willstillbe publily accessible. Entry obsoletion can be requested, and should be justified, by the contact author(s).Once acted upon, an email confirming the obsoletion is sent to the contact author(s). Obsoletion can be followed by",

              "content": "The provided text delivers comprehensive guidance on cryo-EM data deposition, validation, and related policies at wwPDB and EMDB, alongside detailed deposition procedures for macromolecular structures.\n\n**Cryo-EM Data Deposition and Validation (wwPDB/EMDB):**\n\n- Composite maps\u2014created by combining focused maps from targeted local refinement\u2014must be deposited with corresponding atomic models. Global consensus maps and each focused map should be submitted separately as standard single-particle entries, with explicit linking among them during deposition.\n- Key map types include consensus maps (global refinement), focused maps (region-specific refinement), and composite maps (combined focused maps).\n- Atomic coordinate deposition can include coordinates fitted to maps or those derived from rigid-body fitting of existing PDB structures, provided species and sequence match the EM sample precisely.\n- Validation employs tools like EMRinger and MolProbity to assess map-model fit, geometry, and other structural parameters.\n- Atomic models may be updated post-release without changing PDB IDs, but EM maps are immutable after release; corrections require new depositions with distinct accession codes.\n- Depositors should supply EMPIAR accession codes to link raw data with processed maps and models; these can be added post-deposition with curator help.\n- Map-only entries cannot later have models added; new depositions are required to combine maps and models.\n- Each EM entry accepts only one model file, which may contain multiple models; validation focuses on the first model, and all models must be clearly documented.\n- The primary map used for atomic model building must be designated in map+model depositions.\n- Modeling should be restricted to regions with confident density support; speculative modeling beyond map evidence is discouraged.\n- Q-scores measure local map-model agreement but may be low in flexible areas despite good visual fit. Discrepancies between reported and calculated resolutions often arise from data processing artifacts, emphasizing the importance of visual inspection and comparative analysis.\n- Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) data must be submitted in a standardized XML format for validation.\n- In helical reconstructions, \u201csegments\u201d are particle-like filament subsections; \u201cNumber of Segments Used\u201d counts these segments, not protofilaments.\n- Depositors are encouraged to upload unlimited additional maps (e.g., raw, sharpened) with detailed descriptions to facilitate reuse. Validation emphasizes the primary map, model, first mask, and initial half-maps.\n- The pdb_extract tool assists in generating metadata and preparing model and map-only mmCIF files for composite map depositions.\n- \u201cMaximum likelihood\u201d is the recommended angle assignment type for wwPDB deposition for software like CryoSPARC or RELION.\n- Nominal defocus refers to the microscope target value; calibrated defocus is the measured defocus reflecting actual experimental conditions.\n- Structures linked to publications are released promptly upon accession code identification; delays often stem from mismatched author or title information, which depositors should promptly update.\n- EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 map formats, converting all to CCP4 for distribution.\n\n**General Macromolecular Structure Deposition Procedures (wwPDB):**\n\n- Depositors must complete administrative fields before uploading. To deposit related entries, use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option with original IDs and passwords. After clicking \u201cContinue deposition,\u201d importing previous data requires starting a new session.\n- Metadata templates (prepared with pdb_extract) can be embedded within model files to automate and reuse metadata across related entries, reducing manual input.\n- The RCSB PDB Group Deposition system allows submission of multiple related structures in one compressed mmCIF file, requiring shared authorship and release policies; unique Group and PDB IDs are assigned upon submission.\n- pdb_extract harvests coordinate files, experimental data, logs, and templates to generate fully populated PDBx/mmCIF files. Refinement packages like Phenix and Refmac also generate mmCIF files with statistics.\n- PDB format files must follow strict formatting (e.g., complete TER records, correct HETATM lines). Large structures (>99,999 atoms or >62 chains) must use mmCIF format.\n- For symmetric structures, deposit only refined chains plus a file with symmetry operators.\n- Chain ID and residue numbering inconsistencies between input files and validation reports are due to wwPDB annotation assigning unique chain IDs; depositors do not need to modify them.\n- File uploads vary by method:\n  - X-ray/electrocrystallography: coordinate plus structure factor files.\n  - NMR: coordinate, chemical shift, and at least one restraint file; peak lists encouraged.\n  - 3DEM single particle/helical/subtomogram: primary map, two raw half-maps, no-copyright map image, coordinates if applicable; FSC curves, masks optional but encouraged.\n  - 3DEM tomography: primary map plus no-copyright map image; masks encouraged.\n  - 3DEM models derived from existing maps require coordinate files plus EMDB IDs.\n- Raw image data should be indicated as \u201cdiffraction image data\u201d on the Related Entries page with DOI provided.\n- Depositors must supply detailed protein/nucleic acid information (organism, preparation, sequence including tags/mutations), ligand chemical identity (SMILES, images, CCD IDs), and optionally processing/refinement logs.\n- Contact author email, country, and ORCiD are mandatory.\n- Multiple related entries can be deposited via reuse of metadata or the Group Deposition system.\n- To maximize chances of consecutive PDB IDs, complete all fields beforehand and submit quickly during low-traffic periods; simultaneous sessions are unsupported and consecutive ID assignment is not guaranteed.\n- Re-refined structures with existing experimental data require original PDB ID and selection of \u201cre-refinement\u201d content type; third-party reuse policies apply.\n- Multiple experimental methods may be selected, with multiple accession codes assigned. Unsupported methods are submitted via https://data.pdb-ihm.org/.\n- Purely theoretical computational models are not accepted; use the Model Archive instead.\n- Missing software information in the dropdown can be reported via the Communication page for curator update.\n- mmCIF files should ideally be generated by refinement software or wwPDB tools like pdb_extract.\n- Structure factor files can be converted with SF-tool or sf_covert.\n- The \u201cFile Upload\u201d interface accepts required files as specified per method.\n  \nThese rigorous guidelines ensure accurate, transparent, and reproducible deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular structural data, supporting high-quality data sharing and reuse within the structural biology community.",

              "content": "The provided text offers detailed guidance on depositing macromolecular structures using the wwPDB system, focusing on administrative steps, file preparation, metadata handling, and specific cases.\n\n1. **General Deposition Process:**\n   - Complete all relevant administrative fields before uploading.\n   - To deposit related entries, use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option by entering the original deposition ID and password to copy selected data categories.\n   - After uploading files and clicking \u201cContinue deposition,\u201d the import option becomes unavailable; a new session is required to import again.\n\n2. **Metadata Templates:**\n   - For entries sharing metadata (e.g., data collection, protein names, sequences), use a common metadata template prepared with pdb_extract.\n   - This template can be embedded within model files, automating field population and reducing manual entry.\n   - Templates can be saved, modified, and reused; instructions are available on the pdb_extract Help page.\n\n3. **Group Depositions:**\n   - The RCSB PDB Group Deposition system allows submitting multiple related structures in one compressed file.\n   - Requirements: files must be in mmCIF format, entries must share authorship and release policy.\n   - Upon submission, a Group ID and unique PDB ID for each structure are assigned.\n\n4. **File Preparation and Conversion:**\n   - pdb_extract harvests coordinate files, experimental data, processing logs, and author templates to generate fully populated PDBx/mmCIF files for validation and deposition.\n   - Programs such as Phenix and Refmac can also generate mmCIF files with refinement statistics.\n   - PDB format files can be converted to mmCIF using pdb_extract.\n   - For 3DEM and NMR depositions, uploaded PDB files are automatically converted to mmCIF with both versions available for download.\n   - Proper PDB format files must comply with the format guide (http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/v3.3.html), including complete TER records after each polymer chain and correct HETATM lines for ligands/compounds.\n\n5. **Structure Factor File Conversion:**\n   - Structure factor files can be converted to mmCIF using SF-tool or programmatically via sf_covert (https://pypi.org/project/sf-covert/2.1.13/).\n\n6. **Large Entries:**\n   - Structures exceeding 99,999 atoms or 62 chains must be deposited in PDBx/mmCIF format.\n   - For structures with exact symmetry, deposit only refined chains plus a PDB file with symmetry operators to generate the full assembly.\n\n7. **Chain ID and Residue Numbering:**\n   - Discrepancies between input files and validation reports are due to wwPDB annotation policies assigning unique chain IDs based on proximity.\n   - Depositors need not change chain IDs or residue numbers; wwPDB updates these during annotation.\n\n8. **Uploading Files:**\n   - Use the \"File Upload\" page within the deposition interface to upload coordinate and experimental data files.\n   - Required files vary by method:\n     - X-ray/electrocrystallography: one coordinate and one structure factor file.\n     - NMR: coordinate file, chemical shift file, and at least one restraint file; peak list upload is encouraged.\n     - 3DEM single particle, helical, subtomogram: primary map file, two raw half-map files, a no-copyright map image, coordinate file if applicable; FSC curves, masks, and layer lines are optional but encouraged.\n     - 3DEM tomography: primary map and no-copyright map image; masks encouraged.\n     - 3DEM models derived from previous maps require coordinate files plus associated EMDB ID.\n\n9. **Related Experimental Data:**\n   - For raw image data, specify \u201cdiffraction image data\u201d on the \u201cRelated entries\u201d page and provide the DOI.\n\n10. **Information and Files Needed for Deposition:**\n    - Detailed protein/nucleic acid information: source organism, preparation method, experimental sequence (including expression tags, mutations, disordered regions).\n    - Ligands/compounds must have chemical identity information (SMILES, 2D image, molecular definition, or known CCD ID).\n    - Processing and refinement log files are recommended, ideally included via pdb_extract.\n    - Contact authors\u2019 email, country affiliation, and ORCiD are mandatory.\n\n11. **Multiple Related Entries:**\n    - Two main approaches:\n      1. Use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option to reuse administrative metadata.\n      2. Use the Group Deposition system for multiple related structures.\n\n12. **Consecutive PDB IDs:**\n    - To enhance chances of obtaining consecutive PDB IDs for multiple entries, complete all fields in advance, submit sessions quickly in succession, and choose low-traffic times.\n    - Note: Consecutive ID assignment is not guaranteed; the system does not support simultaneous sessions.\n\n13. **Re-Refined Structures with Existing Experimental Data:**\n    - Provide the original PDB ID, select \u201cre-refinement\u201d as content type.\n    - Follow third-party data reuse policies if the original data belongs to a different group.\n\n14. **Experimental Methods:**\n    - Multiple experimental methods can be selected during deposition.\n    - For hybrid methods (e.g., X-ray and neutron), multiple accession codes will be assigned upon submission.\n    - For unsupported methods, submit via https://data.pdb-ihm.org/.\n\n15. **Computational Models:**\n    - Purely theoretical computational models are not accepted in PDB; use the Model Archive (https://www.modelarchive.org).\n\n16. **Software Information Missing in Dropdown:**\n    - Provide missing software details via the Communication page; annotators will guide and update the entry.\n\n17. **Preparing mmCIF Format Files:**\n    - Use refinement software outputs or wwPDB tools (https://pdb-extract.wwpdb.org/) for generating mmCIF files.\n    - Recommended to deposit mmCIF files generated by refinement packages.\n\nThis summary covers all essential instructions and requirements for file preparation, metadata, experimental data, and deposition procedures described in the provided text, preserving all specified details and numerical values.",

              "content": "The document provides detailed guidelines for depositing molecular structures, NMR data, cryo-EM, and other macromolecular structural data via the wwPDB OneDep system and related repositories to ensure accuracy, standardization, and reproducibility.\n\nFor molecular structures and NMR data, the process involves uploading files (e.g., mmCIF, PDB, NMR-STAR, NEF), correcting errors, matching chemical components, submitting detailed polymer sequences (including unknown residues), and entering funding and precise assembly (quaternary structure) information with evidence. NMR depositions require atomic coordinates, experimental restraints, chemical shifts, peak lists, and metadata like pH and temperature. Automatic validation reports check geometry, restraints, chemical shifts, and ensembles; depositors must address errors before final submission, typically linked with journal peer review. Validation reports are provided in PDF and XML format. Policies include confidential curator reviews, mandatory acknowledgment of reports, controlled file replacement (limited coordinate updates post-release), and session expiration after three months. ORCiD login is mandatory for contact authors, with email verification for first-time users. Depositors receive deposition IDs and non-resettable passwords unless using ORCiD. Author lists can be edited during deposition; accession codes are sequentially assigned upon release. Raw data archiving with DOIs is encouraged. The wwPDB annotation process may modify chain IDs and residue numbering, which depositors should not alter. The standalone wwPDB Validation Server is distinct from OneDep and unsuitable for deposition validation but offers API access. Communication with biocurators occurs via the interface or email.\n\nFor cryo-EM data depositions, composite maps plus atomic models must be submitted, with separate but linked global consensus and focused maps. Atomic models can be fitted or derived from existing PDB structures and validated using EMRinger, MolProbity, Q-scores, and FSC metrics (requiring standardized XML submissions). Models can be updated without changing PDB IDs, but maps are immutable post-release; corrections need new depositions. Raw data should be linked via EMPIAR accessions. Only one model per EM entry is allowed, and modeling should be confined to well-defined density areas; speculative modeling is discouraged. Helical reconstructions count filament subsections as segments. Multiple additional maps can be uploaded, though validation focuses on primary map and model. Tools like pdb_extract assist in metadata and composite map deposition. EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 formats but distributes maps in CCP4 format. Structural releases linked to publications occur promptly, with delays mostly due to metadata mismatches.\n\nGeneral macromolecular structure deposition requires completing administrative fields and linking related entries when applicable. Metadata templates and tools like the RCSB PDB Group Deposition system support submitting multiple related structures with shared data. Large or symmetric structures require specific formats and auxiliary files. Differences between depositor input and validation reports in chain IDs or residue numbering require no depositor action. Required files differ by method (e.g., 3DEM demands primary maps, half-maps, and images); raw image data should be linked with DOIs. Detailed sample, ligand, processing, and refinement information must be provided. Depositor contact information, including email, country, and ORCiD, is mandatory. Rapid submission and low-traffic periods improve chances for consecutive PDB IDs. Re-refinements must reference original PDB IDs with appropriate content descriptors. Multiple experimental methods can be indicated; purely theoretical models are excluded. Missing software entries can be requested via curators. MmCIF files should ideally be produced by refinement software or pdb_extract; structure factor files can be converted with special tools. The upload system supports all necessary files per experimental method.\n\nTogether, these practices foster comprehensive, standardized, and transparent deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular data, enhancing data quality, sharing, and reuse in structural biology.",

Instructions to retrieve EMDB data files and metadata are posted on the wwPDB website.6. Modification of entries6.1 Entry changes before releaseBefore public release, most issues can be resolved by communicating with wwPDB staf.After sumission of an EMDB entry,thedeposition is locked for further modifications and changes. Additional data or information may be required, in which case thedeposition may be temporarily unlocked by wwPDB staff. This option is used sparingly to avoid creating inconsistencies in themetadata.6.2 Entry changes after releaseIn some cases, it may be necessary to modify an entry after release. This may apply to both the data and the metadata (e.g..update of the primary citation details). However, the primary map of an EMDB entry cannot be changed after release. Instead,the entry would need to be made bsolete and then replaced by an entrely new deposition. Occasionally, additional data filesmay need to be added or unintentionally uploaded files may need to be removed. Such changes should be discussed withwwPDB staff and should be justied by the contact author(s). Depending on the nature of the changes, it may take some time for them to be reflected in the public archive.7. Removal of entries7.1 Entry obsoletionAn EMDB entry can only be made obsolete after it has been released. Obsoleting an entry changes the status code of thedeposition to OBS and moves its files out of the active part of the public archive into a separate area of the archive where theEMDB entry willstillbe publily accessible. Entry obsoletion can be requested, and should be justified, by the contact author(s).Once acted upon, an email confirming the obsoletion is sent to the contact author(s). Obsoletion can be followed by",

              "content": "The provided text delivers comprehensive guidance on cryo-EM data deposition, validation, and related policies at wwPDB and EMDB, alongside detailed deposition procedures for macromolecular structures.\n\n**Cryo-EM Data Deposition and Validation (wwPDB/EMDB):**\n\n- Composite maps\u2014created by combining focused maps from targeted local refinement\u2014must be deposited with corresponding atomic models. Global consensus maps and each focused map should be submitted separately as standard single-particle entries, with explicit linking among them during deposition.\n- Key map types include consensus maps (global refinement), focused maps (region-specific refinement), and composite maps (combined focused maps).\n- Atomic coordinate deposition can include coordinates fitted to maps or those derived from rigid-body fitting of existing PDB structures, provided species and sequence match the EM sample precisely.\n- Validation employs tools like EMRinger and MolProbity to assess map-model fit, geometry, and other structural parameters.\n- Atomic models may be updated post-release without changing PDB IDs, but EM maps are immutable after release; corrections require new depositions with distinct accession codes.\n- Depositors should supply EMPIAR accession codes to link raw data with processed maps and models; these can be added post-deposition with curator help.\n- Map-only entries cannot later have models added; new depositions are required to combine maps and models.\n- Each EM entry accepts only one model file, which may contain multiple models; validation focuses on the first model, and all models must be clearly documented.\n- The primary map used for atomic model building must be designated in map+model depositions.\n- Modeling should be restricted to regions with confident density support; speculative modeling beyond map evidence is discouraged.\n- Q-scores measure local map-model agreement but may be low in flexible areas despite good visual fit. Discrepancies between reported and calculated resolutions often arise from data processing artifacts, emphasizing the importance of visual inspection and comparative analysis.\n- Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) data must be submitted in a standardized XML format for validation.\n- In helical reconstructions, \u201csegments\u201d are particle-like filament subsections; \u201cNumber of Segments Used\u201d counts these segments, not protofilaments.\n- Depositors are encouraged to upload unlimited additional maps (e.g., raw, sharpened) with detailed descriptions to facilitate reuse. Validation emphasizes the primary map, model, first mask, and initial half-maps.\n- The pdb_extract tool assists in generating metadata and preparing model and map-only mmCIF files for composite map depositions.\n- \u201cMaximum likelihood\u201d is the recommended angle assignment type for wwPDB deposition for software like CryoSPARC or RELION.\n- Nominal defocus refers to the microscope target value; calibrated defocus is the measured defocus reflecting actual experimental conditions.\n- Structures linked to publications are released promptly upon accession code identification; delays often stem from mismatched author or title information, which depositors should promptly update.\n- EMDB accepts MRC and CCP4 map formats, converting all to CCP4 for distribution.\n\n**General Macromolecular Structure Deposition Procedures (wwPDB):**\n\n- Depositors must complete administrative fields before uploading. To deposit related entries, use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option with original IDs and passwords. After clicking \u201cContinue deposition,\u201d importing previous data requires starting a new session.\n- Metadata templates (prepared with pdb_extract) can be embedded within model files to automate and reuse metadata across related entries, reducing manual input.\n- The RCSB PDB Group Deposition system allows submission of multiple related structures in one compressed mmCIF file, requiring shared authorship and release policies; unique Group and PDB IDs are assigned upon submission.\n- pdb_extract harvests coordinate files, experimental data, logs, and templates to generate fully populated PDBx/mmCIF files. Refinement packages like Phenix and Refmac also generate mmCIF files with statistics.\n- PDB format files must follow strict formatting (e.g., complete TER records, correct HETATM lines). Large structures (>99,999 atoms or >62 chains) must use mmCIF format.\n- For symmetric structures, deposit only refined chains plus a file with symmetry operators.\n- Chain ID and residue numbering inconsistencies between input files and validation reports are due to wwPDB annotation assigning unique chain IDs; depositors do not need to modify them.\n- File uploads vary by method:\n  - X-ray/electrocrystallography: coordinate plus structure factor files.\n  - NMR: coordinate, chemical shift, and at least one restraint file; peak lists encouraged.\n  - 3DEM single particle/helical/subtomogram: primary map, two raw half-maps, no-copyright map image, coordinates if applicable; FSC curves, masks optional but encouraged.\n  - 3DEM tomography: primary map plus no-copyright map image; masks encouraged.\n  - 3DEM models derived from existing maps require coordinate files plus EMDB IDs.\n- Raw image data should be indicated as \u201cdiffraction image data\u201d on the Related Entries page with DOI provided.\n- Depositors must supply detailed protein/nucleic acid information (organism, preparation, sequence including tags/mutations), ligand chemical identity (SMILES, images, CCD IDs), and optionally processing/refinement logs.\n- Contact author email, country, and ORCiD are mandatory.\n- Multiple related entries can be deposited via reuse of metadata or the Group Deposition system.\n- To maximize chances of consecutive PDB IDs, complete all fields beforehand and submit quickly during low-traffic periods; simultaneous sessions are unsupported and consecutive ID assignment is not guaranteed.\n- Re-refined structures with existing experimental data require original PDB ID and selection of \u201cre-refinement\u201d content type; third-party reuse policies apply.\n- Multiple experimental methods may be selected, with multiple accession codes assigned. Unsupported methods are submitted via https://data.pdb-ihm.org/.\n- Purely theoretical computational models are not accepted; use the Model Archive instead.\n- Missing software information in the dropdown can be reported via the Communication page for curator update.\n- mmCIF files should ideally be generated by refinement software or wwPDB tools like pdb_extract.\n- Structure factor files can be converted with SF-tool or sf_covert.\n- The \u201cFile Upload\u201d interface accepts required files as specified per method.\n  \nThese rigorous guidelines ensure accurate, transparent, and reproducible deposition of cryo-EM and other macromolecular structural data, supporting high-quality data sharing and reuse within the structural biology community.",

              "content": "The provided text offers detailed guidance on depositing macromolecular structures using the wwPDB system, focusing on administrative steps, file preparation, metadata handling, and specific cases.\n\n1. **General Deposition Process:**\n   - Complete all relevant administrative fields before uploading.\n   - To deposit related entries, use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option by entering the original deposition ID and password to copy selected data categories.\n   - After uploading files and clicking \u201cContinue deposition,\u201d the import option becomes unavailable; a new session is required to import again.\n\n2. **Metadata Templates:**\n   - For entries sharing metadata (e.g., data collection, protein names, sequences), use a common metadata template prepared with pdb_extract.\n   - This template can be embedded within model files, automating field population and reducing manual entry.\n   - Templates can be saved, modified, and reused; instructions are available on the pdb_extract Help page.\n\n3. **Group Depositions:**\n   - The RCSB PDB Group Deposition system allows submitting multiple related structures in one compressed file.\n   - Requirements: files must be in mmCIF format, entries must share authorship and release policy.\n   - Upon submission, a Group ID and unique PDB ID for each structure are assigned.\n\n4. **File Preparation and Conversion:**\n   - pdb_extract harvests coordinate files, experimental data, processing logs, and author templates to generate fully populated PDBx/mmCIF files for validation and deposition.\n   - Programs such as Phenix and Refmac can also generate mmCIF files with refinement statistics.\n   - PDB format files can be converted to mmCIF using pdb_extract.\n   - For 3DEM and NMR depositions, uploaded PDB files are automatically converted to mmCIF with both versions available for download.\n   - Proper PDB format files must comply with the format guide (http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/v3.3.html), including complete TER records after each polymer chain and correct HETATM lines for ligands/compounds.\n\n5. **Structure Factor File Conversion:**\n   - Structure factor files can be converted to mmCIF using SF-tool or programmatically via sf_covert (https://pypi.org/project/sf-covert/2.1.13/).\n\n6. **Large Entries:**\n   - Structures exceeding 99,999 atoms or 62 chains must be deposited in PDBx/mmCIF format.\n   - For structures with exact symmetry, deposit only refined chains plus a PDB file with symmetry operators to generate the full assembly.\n\n7. **Chain ID and Residue Numbering:**\n   - Discrepancies between input files and validation reports are due to wwPDB annotation policies assigning unique chain IDs based on proximity.\n   - Depositors need not change chain IDs or residue numbers; wwPDB updates these during annotation.\n\n8. **Uploading Files:**\n   - Use the \"File Upload\" page within the deposition interface to upload coordinate and experimental data files.\n   - Required files vary by method:\n     - X-ray/electrocrystallography: one coordinate and one structure factor file.\n     - NMR: coordinate file, chemical shift file, and at least one restraint file; peak list upload is encouraged.\n     - 3DEM single particle, helical, subtomogram: primary map file, two raw half-map files, a no-copyright map image, coordinate file if applicable; FSC curves, masks, and layer lines are optional but encouraged.\n     - 3DEM tomography: primary map and no-copyright map image; masks encouraged.\n     - 3DEM models derived from previous maps require coordinate files plus associated EMDB ID.\n\n9. **Related Experimental Data:**\n   - For raw image data, specify \u201cdiffraction image data\u201d on the \u201cRelated entries\u201d page and provide the DOI.\n\n10. **Information and Files Needed for Deposition:**\n    - Detailed protein/nucleic acid information: source organism, preparation method, experimental sequence (including expression tags, mutations, disordered regions).\n    - Ligands/compounds must have chemical identity information (SMILES, 2D image, molecular definition, or known CCD ID).\n    - Processing and refinement log files are recommended, ideally included via pdb_extract.\n    - Contact authors\u2019 email, country affiliation, and ORCiD are mandatory.\n\n11. **Multiple Related Entries:**\n    - Two main approaches:\n      1. Use the \u201cBased on a previous wwPDB deposition\u201d option to reuse administrative metadata.\n      2. Use the Group Deposition system for multiple related structures.\n\n12. **Consecutive PDB IDs:**\n    - To enhance chances of obtaining consecutive PDB IDs for multiple entries, complete all fields in advance, submit sessions quickly in succession, and choose low-traffic times.\n    - Note: Consecutive ID assignment is not guaranteed; the system does not support simultaneous sessions.\n\n13. **Re-Refined Structures with Existing Experimental Data:**\n    - Provide the original PDB ID, select \u201cre-refinement\u201d as content type.\n    - Follow third-party data reuse policies if the original data belongs to a different group.\n\n14. **Experimental Methods:**\n    - Multiple experimental methods can be selected during deposition.\n    - For hybrid methods (e.g., X-ray and neutron), multiple accession codes will be assigned upon submission.\n    - For unsupported methods, submit via https://data.pdb-ihm.org/.\n\n15. **Computational Models:**\n    - Purely theoretical computational models are not accepted in PDB; use the Model Archive (https://www.modelarchive.org).\n\n16. **Software Information Missing in Dropdown:**\n    - Provide missing software details via the Communication page; annotators will guide and update the entry.\n\n17. **Preparing mmCIF Format Files:**\n    - Use refinement software outputs or wwPDB tools (https://pdb-extract.wwpdb.org/) for generating mmCIF files.\n    - Recommended to deposit mmCIF files generated by refinement packages.\n\nThis summary covers all essential instructions and requirements for file preparation, metadata, experimental data, and deposition procedures described in the provided text, preserving all specified details and numerical values.",
